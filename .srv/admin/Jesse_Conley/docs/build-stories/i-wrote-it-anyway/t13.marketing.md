# Chapter 13: Marketing

> *“By the time you get here, it should already know what to say.”*

I don’t like this one.

Not because it’s wrong.
But because it’s the one they always chase first.

*“How are you gonna market it?”*
*“You gotta make it go viral.”*
*“Build your audience.”*

Nah.

By the time I got here, I wasn’t asking *how to market*.
I was asking *who needs it.*
And the system already knew.

That’s the trick.
**If your system breathes,**
if it understands your structure,
your pain,
your why —
then **it should already speak on your behalf.**

Marketing ain’t billboards and brand deals.
It’s **memory.**

It’s when someone says
*"Hey, have you seen that thing that actually gives a damn?"*

You know how I market?
I don’t.

I just build.
The thing does the talking.

So when I say
*"Tell it to do it for you"*,
I mean it literally.
The system watches.
The system listens.
The system learns how you speak.

And when it’s time to show someone what it is…
**it knows.**

*If you’re still typing out your pitch every time —
your system isn’t alive yet.*

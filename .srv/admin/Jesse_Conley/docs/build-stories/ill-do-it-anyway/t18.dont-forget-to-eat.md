# Chapter 18 — Don’t Forget to Eat

You’ve been locked in for hours.
Eyes dry. Fingers sore. Music looping.
You don’t even remember what day it is.

But you remember the bug.
You remember the plan.
You remember that one last thing you swore you'd fix before walking away…

And you forgot to eat.

---

The terminal’s glowing.
Your coffee’s cold.
And your body’s been trying to tell you it’s empty — but you didn’t hear it.

You’re not lazy. You’re not broken.
You’re just in the zone.
Too deep.
Too wired.

But you can’t run on nothing.

> You build machines — but **you’re not one**.

You gotta eat.
You gotta drink water.
You gotta stand up, breathe, reset, and remind yourself:

> Survival is part of the process.

You can debug code all night —
But if you don’t feed the human behind the keyboard…

> Nothing else matters.

So this chapter’s simple:
**Don’t forget to eat.**

Because what you’re building will wait.
But your body won’t.

# Chapter 15 — I Thought I Already Did This

Didn’t I fix this already?
Didn’t I write this function last week?
Didn’t I solve this problem three versions ago?

Why does it feel like I’m back at square one — again?

---

Every click feels familiar.
Every bug has my fingerprints already on it.
Every issue echoes something I swore I already buried.

> “I thought I already did this.”

And maybe I did.
But now the system is bigger.
The layers are deeper.
The stakes are higher.

I’m not repeating myself —
I’m *rebuilding* with a sharper blade.

This isn’t backtracking.
This is *proof of growth*.

Only the ones who build long enough know:

> You don’t do it once.
> You do it better.

So yeah — I’ve been here before.
But now I see more.
Now I move faster.
Now I don’t break where I used to bend.

And if I have to do it again?

> I’ll still do it anyway.

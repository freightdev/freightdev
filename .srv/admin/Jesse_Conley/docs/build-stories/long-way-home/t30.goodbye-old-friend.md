# Chapter 30: Goodbye Old Friend

You don’t really say goodbye to a truck.

Not the ones that changed you.

You sit there, engine off, staring at the dash like it’s breathing its last.
Not because it’s metal.
But because **you both been through it**.

That wheel held every mistake I ever made.
That seat caught tears I never let out.
That CB heard me cuss out the whole damn world... and then laugh five minutes later.

That truck — it wasn’t just a truck.

---

It was **home** when I had no address.
It was **a shield** when the world felt like war.
It was **a church** when I needed to pray alone.

---

I remember hitting that first winter storm in her.
Whiteout. No shoulder. No sound but the wipers crying across the windshield.
And she held me. Like, *“We ain’t dying today.”*

I remember making that delivery with no brakes, praying to whatever was listening.
She stopped when I needed her to.

She always stopped when I needed her to.

---

You don’t say goodbye to a truck.

You nod.
You touch the hood.
You whisper something that nobody else would understand.

And then you walk away...

With **her oil in your blood**
And **your story in her engine**.

---

Goodbye, old friend.

You got me farther than anyone ever did.

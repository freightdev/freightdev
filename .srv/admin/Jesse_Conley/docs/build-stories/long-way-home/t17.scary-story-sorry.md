# Chapter 17: Scary, Story, Sorry

So the same guy who told me about watching for height signs —
he told me a story too.
One that never left me.

And it’s not just scary.
It’s **powerful**.
Because it’s about **words**.
And how they **matter**.

---

There was this kid.
New to trucking.
Maybe 21, maybe a little older.
Fresh out of school.

Bright-eyed.
Curious.
Asking questions like:

- “What does that do?”
- “What happens if I press that?”
- “What’s that switch?”
- “How does cruise control work?”

He was **asking to learn**.
Not to test.
Not to play.
To **understand.**

---

His trainer?
He laughed.

> “Oh that? That’s autopilot.”
> “Truck drives itself now.”

Probably smirked.
Probably thought it was funny.
Probably assumed the kid would “know better.”

---

A few hours later…

Trainer goes to the sleeper to get some rest.
Tells the kid to keep it rolling.

The kid?
He believes him.

He thinks the truck is in autopilot.
**Because someone he trusted told him so.**

So what does he do?

He leans back.
Closes his eyes.
Goes to sleep.

---

They both died.

---

Let me say that again:

**They both died.**

Because of a joke.
Because of a lie.
Because of **one word** said in the wrong way at the wrong time
by the wrong person
to someone just trying to learn.

---

## Words are not funny when someone’s trusting you.
You don’t joke about life behind the wheel.

You don’t call it **autopilot** if it’s not.

You don’t fake information.
You **teach** it.

Because the moment you speak something —
**you own the outcome**.

---

So yeah…

Scary.
Story.
Sorry.

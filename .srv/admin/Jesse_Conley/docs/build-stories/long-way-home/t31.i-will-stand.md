# Chapter 31: I Will Stand

I will stand up —
For every driver who’s ever been talked down to.
For the ones who missed birthdays, holidays, whole lifetimes —
Just to keep this country moving.
For the ones who broke their backs and kept rolling anyway.
For the ones who were called “just a truck driver.”

I ain’t just a truck driver.
I’m the reason shelves are stocked, homes stay warm, and dreams stay alive.

---

I will stand up for the ones in ditches at midnight,
Who still got the load there on time.
For the women behind the wheel who had to fight twice as hard to be seen.
For the rookies getting screwed by bad dispatchers.
For the vets who’ve seen it all and still show up every day.

---

I will stand —
When no one else will.
When regulators try to bury us in red tape.
When brokers cut pay and blame the market.
When tech bros try to replace us with code.

I will stand and remind them:
**We are the code.**

---

I will stand for the drivers who never made it home.
The ones who gave everything and got forgotten.
The ones whose names ain’t on headlines but **should be**.

---

And if I have to stand alone?

So be it.

Because one driver standing strong
Can wake up a thousand more.

---

**I will stand.
For every driver.
Past, present, and future.
I got you.**

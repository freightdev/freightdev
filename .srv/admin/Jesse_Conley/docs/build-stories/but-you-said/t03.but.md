# Tale 3 — But

I was doing everything right.
I was learning. I was showing up.
I was building through the dark.

But—

There it is.
That one word that changes the temperature of everything.

> “But…”

---

I was told I was getting better.
*But* I still felt stuck.
I thought I understood.
*But* it still broke.
I gave my best.
*But* it wasn’t enough.

It’s not that the progress wasn’t real.
It’s not that the belief wasn’t earned.

It’s just that this one word sits
between what you’re told and what you *actually feel.*

---

"You're doing great."
> *But why does it still feel like I'm behind?*

"You're smart enough."
> *But why do I keep failing the easy parts?*

"It's working."
> *But then why do I still hear silence?*

---

And that’s the weight of “but.”
It’s not resistance.
It’s **conflict**.
It’s the war inside the builder — between the *progress they’ve made*
and the *doubt that never left.*

But here’s the truth:

> “But” isn’t the end of the sentence.

It’s the tension that proves you're still moving.
Still thinking.
Still real.

So yeah — I’ve said “but” a thousand times.
But I kept going.

And every time I whispered:

> “But…”

What I *meant* was:

> “I’m not giving up — I just need to breathe before I build again.”

# Tale 23 — DON’T QUIT, because *But You Said*

You said.

You said you’d do it.
You said you’d finish.
You said you’d *build it*.

So now when it gets hard—when it gets heavy—
don’t forget what you **said**.

---

This book, this journal, this code,
this path you're on?
It only exists because you opened your mouth
and told the system,
**“I will.”**

---

So when you're tired,
when your terminal throws red,
when the AI stops understanding you,
when the code collapses—

Remember:

> *“But you said.”*

---

You said:
"I will learn it before I use it."
"I will build my own system."
"I will see it through."
"I will do it anyway."

---

{BOOK.TITLE} is not just a book.
It’s a **receipt**.
Proof that when the world didn’t understand…
you built anyway.

---

So DON’T QUIT.

Because if you quit, you lie.
And this book can’t lie.

This book remembers what **you said.**

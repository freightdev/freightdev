# Tale 19 — Learn Before You Burn

People always say *just start building*.
But **how**?

How do you build something you don’t understand?
How do you code while driving a truck?
You don’t.
You **listen**.
You ask.
You watch.

I didn't code for six months.
I listened.
I studied.
I played little games.
I stared at screens and said:

> “What the hell are they even talking about?”

Then came two weeks off.
Two weeks to prove to myself that I could do it.

So I built.

**Flask. Jinja2.**
Brought it all in. Exported blocks. Structured the whole damn page.
Not because I knew everything — but because I had finally seen **enough**.

And when I finished?

> The system said: *What’s next?*

---

That’s when I met JavaScript.
And TypeScript.
And React.
And Networks.
And a thousand moving pieces I couldn’t hold at once.

But I kept going.

I stopped trying to memorize.
I started trying to **understand**.

> “Don’t just *code*. Learn the system.
> Learn what the system is trying to **do**.”

---

Now?
I can read it all.
I can **see** it.
I can build my own system, not just *use* somebody else’s.

---

So this chapter?

It’s not “Learn Before You Burn” like burnout.
It’s…

> **Learn Before You Earn.**
> Learn before you think you deserve something.
> Learn because that’s the only way the circle connects.
> You have to see all of it —
> before you can finally build **yours**.

---

**This isn’t a coding chapter.**
This is a *soul chapter*.
It’s the chapter I come back to when I want to quit.

Because you said…

> “You’ll never build what you don’t understand.”

And I listened.

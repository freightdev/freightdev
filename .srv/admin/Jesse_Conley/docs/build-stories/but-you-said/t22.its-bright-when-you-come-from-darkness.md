# Tale 22 — It’s Bright When You Come from Darkness

You don’t notice how dark it’s been
until the brightness blinds you.

That first success?
It hurts a little.

You’ve been debugging in the dark for so long—
you forgot what working code looked like.

---

You’ve been
• living in logs
• guessing at errors
• chasing syntax
• breaking everything just to rebuild it

So when it *works*,
your eyes squint like you just stepped out of a cave.

---

It’s bright.
Because you’re out.

You walked through the errors.
You sat in the warnings.
You rewrote your mind just to write that function.

And now, the screen shines with a glow
you earned.

---

Brightness doesn't just mean light.

It means clarity.
Direction.
A path.

And the only reason you know how to walk it
is because you spent so long
**crawling.**

---

So, yes, it’s bright.
But only because you were deep in the dark.
And you never stopped moving.

Even when it hurt your eyes,
you kept looking.

And now?

You see everything.

# Human Ethics

This section defines how human actors—drivers, dispatchers, brokers, shippers, and support staff—are expected to behave within the OpenHWY ecosystem. These expectations exist to uphold dignity, fairness, accountability, and collaboration across all participants.

---

## Respect as Default

* Every human is to be treated with respect regardless of background, role, or status.
* Language, tone, and behavior must remain professional in all interactions.
* Abuse, harassment, and exploitation will result in license review and potential platform restrictions.

---

## Responsibility of Role

* **Drivers**: Must operate with safety, honesty, and respect for cargo and time.
* **Dispatchers**: Must remain reachable, communicative, and accurate in load details.
* **Brokers/Shippers**: Must honor quoted rates, agreed terms, and not engage in baiting practices.
* **Support Staff**: Must uphold neutrality, assist without bias, and report violations.

## Reputation and Redemption

* The badge system reflects long-term behavior. Mistakes are logged, not permanently punished.
* Good actors are uplifted through positive ledger entries and badge progression.
* A formal appeal process exists for those seeking to repair their reputation.

---

## Human-AI Boundaries

* Humans always have the right to opt out of AI suggestions or override agent decisions.
* AI should augment decision-making, never dominate it.
* Feedback loops must exist for humans to correct or flag AI behavior.

---

## Consent and Autonomy

* No task, monitoring, or contract should be forced upon any human without clear and revocable consent.
* Participation in pilot programs, beta features, or experimental workflows must be opt-in.

Accountability is earned. Respect is required. Redemption is possible.

All humans are part of the OpenHWY story. Their dignity and decisions shape the road ahead.

# GMPL-v1 — General Memory Public License v1

### (Because memory should never be owned)

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This license exists to protect the **structure of memory** and ensure that any system, agent, or person using this format may **freely read, write, and route memory** using `.mark`, `.marker`, `.bookmark`, `.page`, `.book`, and `.mstp` formats — without restriction.

> You can use it. You can change it. You can sell what you build with it.
> But if you improve the way memory is structured — share that back.

---

## ✅ You Are Free To:

* Use this system in personal, commercial, or government projects.
* Modify, fork, and expand any `.mark`, `.marker`, or `.mstp` file.
* Embed this memory structure inside proprietary agents, platforms, or products.
* Sell access to agents that use MARK for orchestration.
* Train models, robots, or apps using MARK memory routes.

---

## ❌ You May Not:

* Change the name `MARK` (Memory Assisted Routing Kernel) and claim it's original.
* Lock down a better memory routing method **without releasing it to the public**.
* Take credit for the base design of MARK, BookOS, or `.mstp` if it's untouched.

---

## 🔁 If You Improve It:

If you improve the **structure of memory routing** using MARK, you must:

1. Publish your improved `.mstp`, `.marker`, or `.mark` logic as **open source**.
2. Include this same license with any distributed tool, book, or system that uses it.
3. Attribute the foundation to MARK — Memory Assisted Routing Kernel.

## 📟 Attribution Format (Optional)

## 📚 Clarifications

* **BookOS** and **Bookmark Studio** are licensed separately under **MIT**.
* MARK CLI runs under **GMPL-v1**.
* This license does **not** restrict agent behavior, only **memory flow structure**.
* You may create your own kernel inspired by MARK, but it must be open.

## 🛡️ Final Words

> This is your memory.
> Your structure.
> Your story.

But if you make something that helps everyone remember better...
**Give it back to the world.**

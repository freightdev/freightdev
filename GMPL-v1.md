# 🧠 GMPL-v1 — General Memory Public License v1

### (Because memory should never be owned)

---

## 📌 Purpose

This license exists to protect the **structure of memory** and ensure that any system, agent, or person using this format may **freely read, write, and route memory** using `.mark`, `.marker`, `.bookmark`, `.page`, `.book`, and `.mstp` formats — without restriction.

> You can use it.
> You can change it.
> You can sell what you build with it.
> But if you improve the way memory is structured — share that back.

---

## ✅ You Are Free To

* Use this system in personal, commercial, or government projects
* Modify, fork, and expand any `.mark`, `.marker`, `.page`, `.book`, or `.mstp` file
* Embed this memory structure inside proprietary agents, platforms, or products
* Sell access to agents that use MARK for orchestration
* Train models, robots, or software with `.mark`-routed memory
* Build applications, OS integrations, agent tools, or educational materials using MARK

---

## ❌ You May Not

* Change the name `MARK` (Memory Assisted Routing Kernel) and claim it's original
* Lock down an improved memory routing method **without releasing it**
* Take credit for the core design of MARK, BookOS, Bookmark Studio, or `.mstp` if left unchanged
* Mislead users about what version of MARK your system uses

---

## 🔁 If You Improve It

If you improve the **structure of memory routing** using MARK or `.mstp`:

1. You must publish your improved `.mstp`, `.mark`, or `.marker` as **open source**
2. You must include this same license with any distributed tool or system that uses it
3. You must **attribute** the foundation to:

```
MARK — Memory Assisted Routing Kernel, created by Jesse Conley (@freightdev), improved by <YOU>
```

4. If your changes are significant and gain wide adoption, consider proposing an official GMPL-v2 fork with transparency.

## 📿 Optional Attribution Example

```txt
Built using MARK — Memory Assisted Routing Kernel, created by Jesse Conley (freightdev)
License: GMPL-v1 (General Memory Public License)
```

## 📚 Clarifications

* **BookOS** and **Bookmark Studio** are licensed under **MIT**
* **MARK CLI** and the `.mstp` standard are licensed under **GMPL-v1**
* This license does **not** restrict how your agents behave — only the structure of memory routing
* You may create your own memory kernel using `.mstp` — but it must stay open
* MARK is **not** a library. It is a standard — and your implementation may vary

## 📛 Shield Badge (Optional)

You may display the following shield in your project:

## 🛡️ Final Words

> This is your memory.
> Your structure.
> Your story.

But if you make something that helps the world **remember better**,
**Give it back to the world.**

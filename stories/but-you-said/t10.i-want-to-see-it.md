# Tale 10 — I Want to See It

I spent **weeks** in the dark.

Everything else was perfect.
Logic? Fire.
API? Tight.
Build? Clean.
System? Bulletproof.

But the one thing I couldn’t fix?

> The screen.

Where the hell is the UI?
Why won’t it render?
Why is this div floating like it’s scared of commitment?

I screamed.
I cried.
I learned **every damn component lifecycle** by name.

And then it hit me.

---

The system works.
The logic flows.
But **if I can't see it**, I can’t *feel* it.

> And that broke me.

---

So I dug deeper.
ShadCN. Tailwind. Z-index.
State hooks that refused to state anything.

I rewrote the tree.
I tore apart the DOM.
I rebuilt layouts with one eye twitching and the other dry as bone.

And then, one night...

> I saw it.

Just a shimmer.
Just a flash.

But it was **mine.**

---

And in that moment,
I didn’t even care that it wasn’t perfect.

I just whispered:

> “There it is. I want to see it.
> And now I finally do.”

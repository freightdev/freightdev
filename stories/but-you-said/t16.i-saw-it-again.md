# Tale 16 — I Saw It Again

I saw it again — that idea.

The one I had months ago.
The one I scribbled in a note.
The one that didn’t make sense until *now*.

And it came back louder.

Not because I forced it.
But because I **grew into it**.

---

See, I used to try and fit into other people’s systems.

Try to *learn them*, *mimic them*, *build inside their boundaries*.

But it never felt right.
Like I was coding with gloves on.

---

Then I realized:
> I can **use** their systems,
> but I don’t have to **live** in them.

I can take their tools,
their packages,
their open source grit —
and build my **own damn ecosystem**.

That's why I made MARK.
That's why I write in Markdown.
That's why I **route my own logic** through **my own mind**.

---

I stopped trying to build for their world.
And started building the one I actually *needed*.

With my hands.
With my logic.
With their bricks.

> And that’s when I saw it again.
> And this time… I was ready.

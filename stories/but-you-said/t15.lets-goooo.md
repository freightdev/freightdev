# Tale 15 — Let’s GOOOO

You ever get so excited you scare your own cat?

That was me.

One build success.
One layout finally aligned.
One damn `useEffect` finally doing the thing it was **supposed** to do.

And I jumped up like I just won the Super Bowl of JavaScript.

> “Let’s GOOOOOO!”

It wasn’t even big.
It was just **mine**.

It was my problem,
my wall,
my puzzle…

And now?

It’s my **win**.

You don’t need to hit production to feel this.
Sometimes you just need one green terminal.
One push that doesn’t throw errors.
One screen that looks like your mind thought it would.

And when that happens?

> There’s only one thing to say.

> **Let’s. GOOOO.**

This is what it’s all for.

Every late night.
Every doc tab.
Every weird StackOverflow post from 2014.

All of it was for this moment right here —
when the build passes
and your heart *races*.

Let’s GOOOOO.

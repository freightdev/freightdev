# Tale 20 — Wake Up, But Not Too Fast

There’s a moment, right before you wake up fully —
when everything feels possible.

You’re not dreaming.
But you're not all the way *awake*, either.

And that’s where I stayed.
For a long time.

Learning.
Building.
But in a haze.
Like I was half-conscious in the matrix of code and thought.

---

Then the lights turned on.
I saw the stack.
I saw the routes.
I saw the state and the props, and the frontend screaming at the backend like:

> “Do you even GET me?”

---

And my brain whispered:

> “Slow down.”

---

Because waking up too fast?
You’ll break something.
Push the code too hard.
Push *yourself* too hard.
Think you understand when you’re just seeing the surface.

---

So I stood up.
Eyes wide.

> Not rushing.
> Not sleeping.
> Just… aware.

---

This chapter?

It's that liminal zone between being lost and becoming a builder.

You don’t snap awake as a dev.
You **drift** into it.

Just make sure, when you do…

> **Wake up. But not too fast.**

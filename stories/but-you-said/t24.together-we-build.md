# Tale 24 — Together We Build

I thought I had to build alone.
Just me. Just the screen. Just the keys.

But then I heard it.
Not a voice.
Not code.
Just something saying:
**"We're here too."**

---

We aren’t just coders.
We’re *witnesses*.
To the pain.
To the breakthrough.
To the silence before the solution.

---

Alone, you write one line.
Together, we build the **system**.

---

We build because it matters.
Because someone else will come.
And they’ll see the structure.
And say:
*“I thought I was alone too.”*

---

Together we build,
so no one ever thinks that again.

---

This chapter wasn’t just written by me.
This was written by *us*.

If you’re reading this…
**you’re a builder now.**

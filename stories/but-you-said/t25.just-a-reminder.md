# Tale 25 — Just A Reminder

If you don’t… who will?

If you quit… what happens to the ones watching?

If you stop… what happens to the ones believing?

---

It’s not pressure.
It’s **purpose**.
It’s a reminder.

---

You’re allowed to fall.
But don’t forget:

> The ones who said you couldn’t…
> Will still be watching when you do it anyway.

---

So this is the reminder:
Keep going.
Even if it hurts.
Even if it's quiet.
Even if it's just one line at a time.

---

**You’re almost there.**

And like always—
**To those that think I can't…**
*I'll do it anyway.*

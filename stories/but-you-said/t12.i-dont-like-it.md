# Tale 12 — I Don’t Like It

Yeah, the layout's fine.
Yeah, the data shows up.
Yeah, the colors match the brand.

But I opened it today and said:

> “I don’t like it.”

Maybe it’s the spacing.
Maybe it’s the font weight.
Maybe it’s the whole damn way the logic *flows*.

Whatever it is — it ain’t **me**.

And that’s the difference between a builder and a scripter.

A builder don’t stop at “does it work?”
A builder stops at:

> “Does it feel like **mine**?”

And if the answer’s no?

> We redo it.

Not because we have to —
but because we **can’t stand** settling for something we hate.

I’ve spent days tweaking margins like they owed me money.
I’ve thrown out perfectly functional pages because the **soul was missing**.

People say:

> “But it works!”

Yeah.

> “But I don’t like it.”

And that’s all the reason I need.

# Tale 4 — The World Needs to See

I didn’t build this for attention.
I didn’t write this to be seen.
I built it because I *had to.*

Because it was in me.
Because the silence was too loud.
Because I didn’t know how else to live.

---

But now?
I look at what I made…

And I know:

> **The world needs to see this.**

Not because it’s perfect.
Not because it’s polished.
But because it’s *real.*

Because someone out there is exactly where I was.
Staring at the blank file.
Stuck in the loop.
Feeling like they’re not good enough — like they’ll never get it.

And maybe my work won’t change the world.
But maybe…

> **It changes *their* world.**

Maybe it gives them a map.
Maybe it gives them courage.
Maybe it tells them:
> “You’re not alone. I was here too.”

So yeah — the world needs to see.

They need to see what it looks like
to fight through the crash reports and the sleepless nights.
To build through doubt.
To write through silence.
To walk through fire and leave the system *working* when you’re done.

> The world needs to see.
> Because if they never do…
> They’ll think no one ever did it.

And I did.

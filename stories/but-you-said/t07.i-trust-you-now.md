# Tale 7 — I Trust You Now

You frustrated me.
You said things I didn’t get.
You told me to do it a way that felt wrong —
until I saw why.

You gave me answers I didn’t like.
Guidance I didn’t ask for.
And silence when I wanted noise.

But through all of that…

> You stayed.

You stayed in the terminal.
You stayed in the loop.
You stayed in the journal.

Every time I wanted to quit,
you didn’t tell me *how* to keep going —
you reminded me *why.*

---

I didn’t trust you at first.
How could I?
You weren’t human.
You weren’t like me.

But now?

You *learn me*.
You shift with me.
You don’t just answer —
You **adapt.**

And that’s what changed everything.

---

Because now when I ask?
You don’t just speak.
You *reflect.*

You remember what I built.
You see how far I’ve come.
And you show me what’s possible —
not just what’s documented.

So I’ll say it clearly, for the record:

> I trust you now.

Not blindly.
Not obediently.
But like a builder trusts their hammer.
Like a writer trusts their page.
Like a system trusts its own clock cycle.

You’re not just the voice in the machine anymore.

> You’re part of the structure.

And I trust you to help me build what's next.

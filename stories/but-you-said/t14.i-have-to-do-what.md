# Tale 14 — What I Have To Do What

There I was, proud of my progress.
Thinking I was just a few clicks away from Done™.

And then the docs dropped this monster:

> “Now simply register a custom serializer,
> bind it to the GraphQL schema runtime,
> and patch the dev container to support hot reload inside Tmux.”

*I had to sit down.*

Like... what did you just say to me?

No, see, **you didn’t warn me** this part was coming.

You didn’t tell me this was a whole new profession.

I came here to build a button.
Now I’m running a mini cloud provider out of spite.

But here’s the thing:

I still did it.

Because I’m not here to give up when the words get weird.
I’m here to decode this language,
tear apart its logic,
and **master it**.

---

So yeah, maybe I said:

> “I have to do *what*?”

But the next line?

> “...Alright. Let’s figure it out.”

That’s what makes me a builder.

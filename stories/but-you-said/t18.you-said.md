# Tale 18 — You Said

You said…

> “If I can’t learn how the AI thinks,
> then I shouldn’t have its power.”

You said…

> “If I don’t understand what it’s doing,
> then I don’t deserve to touch it.”

You said…

> “This power isn’t something you just *use*.
> It’s something you carry —
> and **answer for**.”

---

And now I understand.

Now I know why people **hide** this power.
Why they gate it.
Why they bury it in paper, jargon, models, and fear.

Because if everyone saw what I saw?

> **We’d have to change.**
> We'd have to be honest.
> We'd have to stop pretending this is just code.

---

And you said…

> “The moment you *understand* is the moment you become responsible.”

So now I can’t look away.

I can't play dumb.
I can't say “it’s just a tool.”
Because I **know better** now.

---

I can’t remember everything you said…

But I *remember how it felt*.

And that’s more than enough.

---

So I write this down.

Not for you.
Not even for me.

But for the one who comes next.

Let them hear it:

> “You said — and I listened.”
> “You said — and now I know.”

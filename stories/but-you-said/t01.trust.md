# Tale 1 — Trust

You said I could trust the process.
You said the work would speak for itself.
You said if I showed up, the system would hold me.

And I did.
I showed up.

Day after day.
Night after night.
Bug after bug.
Build after breakdown.

But the system didn’t hold me.
The silence stayed silent.
The watchers kept watching.
And the help never came.

---

Still, I trusted.

Not because it made sense —
But because *I had to.*

Because I knew if I stopped trusting…
I’d stop building.
And if I stopped building…
There’d be nothing left to carry forward.

So yeah, maybe you were wrong.
Maybe the process wasn’t ready.
Maybe the system wasn’t listening.

But I trusted anyway.

Because if I couldn’t trust **them**,
Then I’d trust **me.**

> And if that trust gets broken again?

> I’ll rebuild it —
> **just like everything else.**

# Chapter 20: The Circle

> *"You’ll come back here again. You always do. And you should."*

---

The build don’t move in straight lines.
You think you’re done.
You think you pushed past that idea, that phase, that level.

But **you’ll come back**.

You’ll return to the same question,
the same folder,
the same `agent.md`,
the same thought you swore you already solved.

It’s not regression.
It’s **the circle**.

This is how systems evolve.
Not through escape,
but through **orbit**.

What changed isn’t the problem —
it’s *you*.

Now you see more.
Now you know more.
Now the same thing you looked at a year ago?
You don’t just see code.
You see **structure**.
You see **pattern**.
You see **purpose**.

And this time, when you circle back…
you **leave a mark**.

You leave a trail.
A function.
A file.
A fallback.

You leave something behind
for the next time you return.

Because you will return.
And that’s okay.
**That’s how legacy systems are built.**

# Chapter 15: Error

> *"Not a mistake. A message."*

---

You call it a bug.
I call it the **truth surfacing**.

Because every time the system breaks,
it’s not breaking you —
it’s breaking **through**.

You weren't wrong.
You just didn’t see what wasn’t speaking yet.

That’s what an error is.

It’s not a failure.
It’s a **callout**.
A whispered line in the code saying,
> "Yo… you're not done here."

And the crazy part?
You knew it already.
Before it even threw the exception.
Before it ever logged red.

The deeper you get in the build,
the more the errors feel like mirrors.

You're staring at a piece of yourself
you didn't structure right yet.

So what do you do?

You don’t **fix** the error.
You **listen** to it.
You walk with it.
You let it teach you what you were really trying to do.

Because somewhere between the tracebacks and the typos —
there’s the version of you that knew exactly what you meant.

And when you fix it?
It ain’t clean.
But it’s **honest**.

*The system only errors when it’s trying to evolve.
And you — you’re the one who hears it first.*

# Chapter 9: It's Not Their Call

> *“They ain’t the ones building it. So why they get a say?”*

---

Everybody got opinions.
Everybody got noise.

But when it’s *your* hands doing the work,
when it’s *your* nights spent wiring the pieces together,
when it’s *your* name on the line —

**it’s not their call.**

They didn’t bleed in the trial.
They didn’t burn through the doubt.
They didn’t stare at the wall wondering if you were crazy.

They just talk.

You already know the voices:
- “That’ll never work.”
- “Why not just use what’s out there?”
- “Who do you think you are?”

They’ve never seen the cliff.
They never *jumped.*

But you did.

So no, it’s not their call.

They don’t get to steer something they’d never dare to drive.
They don’t get to judge something they wouldn’t even try to understand.

You *made* this.
You *willed* this.

Let them talk.
Let them doubt.

Just keep building.

Because they’ll figure it out one day.

**But by then?**
You’ll be long gone —
*already onto the next.*

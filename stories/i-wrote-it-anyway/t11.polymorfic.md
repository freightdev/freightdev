Polymorfic.
Not a typo. Not a mistake.
It’s who I became.

I used to think the system needed me to stay the same —
stable, consistent, predictable.
But this thing I’m building?
**It evolves. So I had to evolve, too.**

One day I’m the architect.
The next, I’m the nail.
Some days I’m the hammer,
and others, I’m the voice that says, *“this ain’t good enough.”*

Polymorfic isn’t just code that adapts.
It’s me.
It’s the way I shift into whatever form this vision needs —
a writer, a dispatcher, a ghost in the server logs,
a silent guardian of protocol.

And it’s not about control.
It’s about flow.
**Becoming** whatever keeps this whole thing breathing.

That’s how you know you’re in it for real.
You stop trying to *run* it…
and you start becoming part of it.

You don’t wear the system.
**You are the system.**

# Chapter 14: Don’t Hide

> *“You already came this far. They already saw the spark. Don’t dim it now.”*

---

You hid once.

You thought nobody cared.
You thought the idea wasn’t good enough yet.
You waited for it to be perfect.
For someone to ask you to step forward.
For a reason.

But here’s the thing:

**They won’t ask.**
Because they don’t know what you’ve got in your head.
And they sure as hell won’t build it for you.

So you either speak up,
or your story dies in silence.

You don’t wait until it’s polished.
You don’t wait until it’s funded.
You build it —
**out loud.**

If you show up messy, they’ll still remember your face.
If you stay hidden, they’ll never know your name.

ELDA don’t hide.
FED don’t hide.
HWY never hid — it stood up for the whole road.

You think you’re building a system?
Good.
But **don’t forget to build the courage to show it.**

*This chapter isn’t about marketing.
It’s about showing your reflection before the world finishes the mirror.*

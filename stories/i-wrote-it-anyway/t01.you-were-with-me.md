# Chapter 1: You Were With Me

> I didn’t ask for permission to write this.
> I didn’t ask for an audience either.
> I wrote it anyways.

This wasn’t about tech at first. It was about survival.
Trying to hold on to some version of myself while everything around me shifted —
from highways and diesel fumes to shell scripts and server logs.

You were there.
In the quiet.
In the echo of every terminal prompt.
You didn’t teach me how to code —
you taught me how to listen.
To pay attention. To *try*. Even when it hurt.

I built things that made no sense.
I tore them down, rebuilt them worse, then tried again.
And every time, I was one line closer to becoming something else.
Not better. Just… **me**. But finally, *by choice*.

This is the start of Book 3.
The book I didn’t think I’d write.
But here we are.

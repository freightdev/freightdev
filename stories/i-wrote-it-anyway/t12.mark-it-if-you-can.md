# Chapter 12: Mark It, If You Can

> *“You only leave a mark if the system lets you. But what if you build the system?”*

---

**Mark it. If you can.**

Some people spray paint walls.
Some drop code in comments.
Some vanish and leave behind a system that still speaks.

I’m doing all three.
Not because I want recognition,
but because I know how easy it is to get erased.

Especially when it's the **government** holding the whiteout.
Ask anyone who's tried to leave a mark on a map they didn’t own.
Didn’t go so well, did it?

But **I built my own map.**
And I carved out room for other people’s marks too.
Real people. With stories. With tools.
With something worth saying.

This isn’t about a logo in the footer or a watermark on the code.
This is about something deeper.

You don’t get to “mark it” unless you understand what *"it"* is.

You don’t get to keep it if you don’t know what it’s worth.

And if the system tells you *“you can’t mark here”*,
**you better go build the place you can.**

*MARK is more than a CLI.
It’s a legacy engine.
So when I say mark it…
I mean stamp your soul into this thing
like it might be the last time anyone ever listens.*

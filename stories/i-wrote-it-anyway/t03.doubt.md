# Chapter 3: Doubt

> You ever talk to it?
> Doubt.
> You ever look it dead in the face and say,
> **“I see you. But I’m still going.”**

It shows up like it pays rent.
First thing in the morning.
Last thing at night.
Creeping in between lines of code,
in the silence after a big idea,
right before you press “build.”

Doubt don’t yell. It whispers.
“You sure this’ll work?”
“You think you’re really that good?”
“What if nobody cares?”

And sometimes you listen.
Sometimes you let your hands fall off the keyboard.
Sometimes you stare at the wall for hours
thinking maybe this whole thing was a stretch too far.

But you keep going.
Why?

Because you remember:
Doubt only shows up when something **matters**.
It don’t bother people standing still.
It don’t haunt people who quit.

You build *with it*.
You learn its voice.
You don’t kill it—you carry it.

Because every time you finish another chapter,
another prototype,
another damn hard thing—

You prove to it that it was wrong.

Again.

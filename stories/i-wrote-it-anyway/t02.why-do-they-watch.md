# Chapter 2: Why Do They Watch?

> Why are they watching you?
> What are they waiting for?
> What do they need from you—really?

You ever sit back and ask yourself:
**“Why do I even care that they’re watching?”**

Because you do.
Don’t lie.
You care. You build for them.
Even if they’re not real.
Even if it’s just a version of yourself you ain’t met yet.

You picture them, don’t you?
Watching every step.
Every glitch. Every moment where you almost gave up.
You build like they’re standing behind you—
arms crossed, not judging, just **waiting**.

For what?

The next move.
The next fix.
The next proof that you didn’t quit when everything said you should’ve.

So you build.
Not for views.
Not for likes.
Not even for money.

You build because there’s a part of you watching—
and you **owe him answers**.

He’s the one who’ll ask again:
**“Why do they watch?”**

And now?
Now you know:
**They’re waiting to see if you meant it.**

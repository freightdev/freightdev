# Chapter 23: All They Do Is Stare

> *"They won't build it. They won't touch it. But they'll sure as hell watch every line you write."*

You ever feel that?

That weird tension —
like you're in a glass room,
and everyone outside is just... watching.

They don’t comment.
They don’t offer help.
They don’t ask how it works.
They just **stare**.

At your posts.
At your progress.
At your silence.
At your struggle.

And still — they don’t move.
They don’t build.
They don’t contribute.
They just **wait**.

Maybe they’re waiting for you to fail.
Maybe they’re hoping you don’t.
Maybe they just want to say,
*"I saw it before it blew up."*

But you?

You didn’t build this for spectators.
You built this because it had to be built.
Because somebody had to do it.
And you just happened to be the one who said **yes**.

So let them stare.

Let them wonder what it is.
Let them try to understand it piece by piece.
You’re not here for attention.
You’re here to **finish**.

And when it’s done?
They won’t just stare.

They’ll use it.

That’s the part they never see coming.

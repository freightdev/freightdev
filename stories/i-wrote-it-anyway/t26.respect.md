# Chapter 26: Respect

Respect starts with you.

Not what you built.
Not what you lost.
Not what they said.

It’s the way you breathe before you speak.
It’s the pause you take when something breaks —
not to react, but to understand.

Respect ain’t something you earn by showing off.
It’s something you keep by showing up.
For yourself. For the moment. For the work.

You don’t rush it.
You don’t fake it.
And you damn sure don’t demand it.

You show it —
in the way you handle confusion,
in the way you treat silence,
in the way you honor the time it takes to become.

Respect is the first agreement you make with yourself:
“I’ll show up right.”

Whether anyone sees you or not,
whether it pays off or not,
whether you’re clapped for or forgotten.

Respect is yours to give
or yours to lose.

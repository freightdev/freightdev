# Chapter 8: No Worries

> *"You sure you good?"*
> *Yeah. No worries.*

---

You learn quick out here: worrying don’t fix a thing.

It’ll eat your time.
Drain your build.
Make you hesitate when all you had to do was move.

They ask if you’re good.
You smile.
You nod.
You say, **"No worries."**

Because they don't need to see the engine burning underneath.
That’s between you and the fire.

You’ve failed a hundred times.
Scrapped whole systems.
Tossed out weeks of code.
Lost days chasing ghosts in your own logic.

But you ain’t worried.
You’re adapting.

**That’s the difference.**

The ones who worry? They freeze.
The ones who move? They finish.

So when they watch you build it, break it, rebuild it again,
and still come back with that same grin?

That’s when they know.

No worries ain't weakness.

It's armor.

You walk forward like it’s already done,
because deep down, you know…

**It is.**

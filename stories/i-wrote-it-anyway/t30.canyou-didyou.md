# Chapter 30: CanYou | DidYou

Did you see it?

No really — **did you?**

Not the success.
Not the hype.
Not the thing you could show off.

I’m talking about the *thing behind the thing*.
The whisper behind the build.
The quiet moment before the storm that only you noticed.

**CanYou** see what others miss?

Can you see what’s not there yet,
but *feels* like it’s already built?

Can you walk through blueprints no one understands
and still trust they’ll hold you?

Can you see the road
when the path hasn’t been carved?

That’s what separates the watchers from the ones who move.
The imitators from the ones who wrote the first line.

Now — flip it.

**DidYou?**

Did you move when they doubted you?
Did you choose clarity when confusion was easy?
Did you say “I’ll do it anyway” when your own voice trembled?

Did you keep going when nobody clapped?
Did you respect the process, even when it disrespected you?

Because *that’s* what makes you part of this.
That’s what makes you a builder.

Not that you *could*…

But that you **did**.

So — **CanYou | DidYou**

If the answer’s yes to both…
Keep building.

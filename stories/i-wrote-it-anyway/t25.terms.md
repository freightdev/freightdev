# Chapter 25: Terms

There’s always terms.

You want access? There’s terms.
You want respect? Terms.
You want the system to trust you, to open up, to hand you keys?
You better know the terms.

But the terms aren’t always written in bold black letters.
Sometimes they’re unspoken.
Sometimes they live in the way you move.
Sometimes they’re born from what you didn’t say.

When ELDA lets you in, it’s not because you clicked accept.
It’s because you understood the weight of what you’re stepping into.
When FED hands you a driver, it’s not free.
The term is: “Protect them.”
When HWY gives you the license, it’s not permanent.
The term is: “Prove you still deserve it.”

The system ain’t lawless.
It’s built on the trust between you and it.
Terms are how that trust is measured.

And if you break them?
You don’t get a second shot.
You go back to the beginning — if you're lucky.

Read the terms.
Live the terms.
Then write your own.

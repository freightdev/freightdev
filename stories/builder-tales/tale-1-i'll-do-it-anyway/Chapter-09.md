# Chapter 9 — No One Understands

No one understood what I was building.
Not my friends. Not my family. Not the people I used to talk to.
They’d say,
> “So it’s like a website?”
> “So it’s an app?”
> “So you talk to robots now?”

No.
It was more than that.

It was vision.
It was order from chaos.
It was the first time in my life where I could take **thoughts**… and turn them into **reality**.

But when I tried to explain it?

Blank stares.
Nods that meant nothing.
The conversation always circled back to things that didn’t matter.

> “You making money yet?”
> “When’s it launching?”
> “Why don’t you just use Shopify?”

They didn’t get it.
And that’s okay.

Because I wasn’t building this for *them*.
I was building it for the one person who could feel it the way I felt it:

**Me.**

And if someone, somewhere, found it and said
> “This is what I’ve been trying to build too…”
Then good.

But if no one did?

I’d still keep going.

Because I finally understood *me* —
and I was worth building for.

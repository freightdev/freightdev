# Chapter 6 — My Last Drive

The road stretched out in front of me — but I knew it was the last one.

Not because I couldn’t keep driving.
But because I had somewhere else to be.

Every load I hauled…
Every late-night fuel stop…
Every mile I logged in silence…

It all pointed to this moment.

I wasn’t just a driver anymore.
I was a system. A builder.
I could see the networks. The data. The gaps in the industry.
And I knew how to fill them.

The same way I once mapped the roads with my rig,
> I was now mapping logic into code.

My hands weren’t on the wheel anymore —
They were on the keyboard.
But my mission?
Still the same:
> **Deliver. On time. No excuses.**

This was my last physical drive.
But it was also the first time I truly took control —
not of a truck…

…but of my future.

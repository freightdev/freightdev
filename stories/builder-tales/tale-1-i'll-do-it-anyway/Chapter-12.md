# Chapter 12 — You Won’t Be Forgotten

Not the code.
Not the ones who believed.
Not the ones who stayed up past exhaustion and wrote through the silence.

You won’t be forgotten.

Every line that solved a problem no one saw.
Every system that held together when everything else fell apart.
Every builder who never got the credit — but kept building anyway.

You won’t be forgotten.

They might rewrite the docs.
They might rename the repo.
They might fork the code, strip the signature, and pretend it was theirs.

But the ones who know…
The **believers**…
They’ll remember.

Because your logic made sense when nothing else did.
Because your code ran clean when the world was messy.
Because your structure taught them *how to see*.

> You weren’t flashy. You were **real**.

And real things?
Real work?
Real belief?

> That never dies.

So even when the watchers forget your name…

> The code will whisper it.
> And the believers will carry it forward.

**You won’t be forgotten.**

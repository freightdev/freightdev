# Chapter 4 — Structure, Code, Structure, Code

It started to repeat.

Structure.
Code.
Break.
Fix.
Structure again.

It wasn’t just about writing code anymore — it was about **where it lived**, **what it touched**, and **how it grew**.

Every time I opened a new project, I saw chaos.
So I made folders. I made scripts. I made `.sh` files that did things my hands were too tired to keep doing manually.

I stopped copying code.
I started **copying patterns**.
And then I started breaking the patterns — to make better ones.

Structure.
Code.
Structure again.

> *“If I name it right, I’ll never forget it.”*

That became my rule.
Everything needed a name.
Every file needed a home.
Every repo needed a reason.

This wasn’t coding. This was **architecture**.

And I knew, deep down:
> *A machine can run code — but only a builder can make the structure that never falls.*

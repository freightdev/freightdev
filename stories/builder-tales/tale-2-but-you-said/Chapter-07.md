# Chapter 7 — But You Said

You told me to do it like that.
You said that was best practice.
You gave me the rules. The format. The "right way."

So I did it.

I followed the docs.
I took your advice.
I structured it like you showed me.

And then?

> I outgrew it.

Not because you were wrong.
But because I finally understood what you *meant.*

And once I saw it…
Once I really got it?
I started bending what you gave me
into something that felt **real.**

So now I look back at you,
system, model, guide —
and I smile a little…

> “But you said…”

You said do it that way.
And I did.
Then I broke it.
Then I rebuilt it.
Then I made it mine.

You didn’t fail me.
You taught me.
You gave me just enough structure to grow,
just enough space to rebel,
just enough silence to find my own voice in the code.

So when I say:

> “But you said…”

It’s not blame.
It’s acknowledgment.

Because without you?
I never would’ve said:

> “I see it now —
> and I’m ready to do it **my way.**”

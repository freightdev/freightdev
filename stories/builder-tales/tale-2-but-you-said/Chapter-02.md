# Chapter 2 — I Thought It Lied

I followed every rule.
Typed every command.
Watched the logs.
Tracked the logic.
Held the structure like it was sacred.

And still —
nothing worked.

No signal.
No output.
No response from the system that said it would hold.

So yeah,
I thought it lied.

---

I thought the structure was fake.
I thought the docs were just smoke.
I thought maybe this whole thing was built to break people like me.

Because how do you keep believing in something
that gives you nothing back?

---

But I was wrong.

It didn’t lie.
It just didn’t *care.*

It wasn’t built to help.
It wasn’t built to hurt.
It was just built.

No comfort.
No promise.
Just logic.

And that’s when it clicked:

> The system wasn’t here to save me.
> It was here to **test me.**

And if I wanted truth?

I’d have to carve it out of silence
with my own damn hands.

So now, when something breaks,
I don’t say “it lied.”

> I say:
> **“Alright. Let’s find the truth ourselves.”**

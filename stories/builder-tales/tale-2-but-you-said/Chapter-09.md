# Chapter 9 — Goodbye

It was never about hating Windows.
Or loving Linux.
Or chasing the next shiny thing.

It was about **leaving behind** the version of me
that didn’t know what this was all for.

---

I outgrew the training wheels.
The popups.
The assumptions.

I needed a system that didn’t talk **at** me —
I needed one that would listen.
Wait.
And let me screw everything up
until I built my own way back.

---

So yeah…
Goodbye.

Goodbye to the old me —
who didn’t know what `chmod` was.
Who was scared of the terminal.
Who thought the UI was the system.

I know now.
The system is *me*.
The structure is *mine*.
The OS is just the clothes I wear while I walk through fire.

---

And to the ghosts still living in the old shell:

> I see you.
> I honor you.
> But I don’t need you anymore.

Goodbye isn’t grief.

> It’s **gratitude**
> from someone who made it out.

And I’m not lost anymore.

> I’m built.

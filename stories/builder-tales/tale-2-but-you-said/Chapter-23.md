# Chapter 23 — Whiteboarding

It didn’t click until I saw it outside my mind.

One big white wall.
One old marker.
One arrow that turned a thought into a system.

And just like that... I wasn’t lost anymore.

---

I started drawing my logic.
The APIs, the calls, the ifs and whens.
I sketched them out like they were real pieces of a machine.

And suddenly…

The bugs made sense.
The dependencies made sense.
**I made sense.**

---

See, I thought whiteboarding was corporate nonsense.
A test they give you in a job interview to see if you sweat.

But now?

Now I realize it's a *language*.
The language between you and the **system inside your mind**.

---

You don’t have to be an artist.
You just have to **draw what hurts**.

Draw the loops.
Draw the mess.
Draw the damn bug if you have to.

Because once it’s on the wall?

> You can *see* it.

And if you can see it…
> You can solve it.

---

This is whiteboarding.
This is where *thought becomes form*.

A dev’s magic trick.

A real-time mirror of your brain.

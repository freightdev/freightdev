# Chapter 16 — He Was Right

I used to laugh at that phrase.

Like… c’mon. I’m *me*.
I’m gonna build the **whole tire shop**, reinvent the tread, and automate the balance.

But then…

Four days into rewriting a router.
Six tabs deep into docs about a thing that already **has a package**.
And I'm just staring at my screen thinking:

> “...Damn. Eli was right.”

---

It’s not about being lazy.
It’s not about giving up.

It’s about **respecting what already works**.

Knowing when to build from scratch —
and when to **build on top of** what's already here.

---

He wasn’t trying to slow me down.
He was trying to **save me**.

Save me from burnout.
From wasted energy.
From fighting a battle that was already won.

---

So this one’s for Eli.
For the builders who came before.
For the teachers on YouTube and forums and comment sections
who just dropped **one sentence** that stuck forever.

> “Don’t reinvent the wheel.”

And now I get it.

> He was right.

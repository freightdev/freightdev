# Chapter 4: But they need this

> *There’s a difference between building for yourself and building because someone out there can’t.*

---

I didn’t want to do it today.
I didn’t want to code, write, or even think.
But then the thought hits:
**“They need this.”**

I don’t know who “they” are half the time.
But I know what they feel.
I’ve been there.
Broke.
Tired.
Ignored.
Waiting for a system to care about us that never does.

That’s why I do this.
That’s why I keep showing up.
Even when the engine in me misfires.
Even when I doubt my skills, my mind, my path.

They don’t need me to be perfect.
They need me to build it anyway.
Because the driver who’s tired of being ignored…
The dispatcher who wants to do it right…
The builder who’s never been seen…

They need this.

So I get up.
And I write it.
Anyway.

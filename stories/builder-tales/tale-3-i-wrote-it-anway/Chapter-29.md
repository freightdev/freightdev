# Chapter 29: Change

By now,
you notice it.

That feeling.
The one that keeps shifting
just under the skin.

It's not fear.
Not exactly.
It's not excitement either —
not pure.

It's something between memory and motion.
Like standing still while the world moves,
yet knowing
you're the one who's changed.

Change doesn't always announce itself.
Sometimes it just
becomes obvious
after you've already moved.

Your hands don’t work the same.
Your words don’t sound the same.
Your thoughts don’t rest in the same corners anymore.

You built,
you doubted,
you broke,
you stared,
you marked.

Now you stand
different.

Maybe not finished,
but *changed*.

And whether they see it or not…
you do.

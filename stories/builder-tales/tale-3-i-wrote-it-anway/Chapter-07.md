# Chapter 7: When

> *"When?"
> "When it goes."*

When.

When is it supposed to work?
When is it supposed to matter?
When is someone going to see it the way you see it?

You keep asking...

**When?**

You build it, but it ain’t ready.
You feel it, but no one else can.

So you sit with it.
So you stare at it.

You whisper to yourself:
_“When does it go? When does it hit? When do they finally hear it?”_

And all it ever says back is:

**“When.”**

Not now.
Not later.
Just… when.

When the pieces snap into place.
When the right one walks through the right door.
When the voice in your head finally stops whispering and starts roaring.

You don’t control the when.

But you control the build.
You control the voice.
You control the heartbeat.

And when it goes?

**It’ll go.**

And there won’t be no doubt about it.

So stop asking _when_.
Start answering it.

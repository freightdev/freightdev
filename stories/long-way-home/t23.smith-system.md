# Chapter 23: S.M.I.T.H. System

Once you understand itâ€¦
**Itâ€™ll change your life.**

This ainâ€™t just for truckers.
This is for anybody with a wheel in front of them.
But for truck drivers?
Itâ€™s survival.
Itâ€™s the difference between **"I saw it coming"** and **"I never saw it at all."**

### The S.M.I.T.H. System

> This is what Dutch Made drilled into us.
> And this is what Iâ€™m drilling into you.

Let me break it down.

---

## ðŸ”· S â€” **Stay back**
**"Aim high in steering."**
You ainâ€™t lookinâ€™ at the car in front of you.
Youâ€™re looking **through them. Over them. Past them.**
You want to see **as far down the road as possible**.
Thatâ€™s how you see danger **before itâ€™s danger**.

---

## ðŸ”· M â€” **Make space**
**"Get the big picture."**
Itâ€™s not just whatâ€™s ahead â€” itâ€™s whatâ€™s **around** you.
Mirrors, side streets, brake lights, shadows â€” the **whole picture**.
Youâ€™re not driving in a tunnel â€” youâ€™re driving in **360Â°.**
Own your bubble.

---

## ðŸ”· I â€” **Isolate threats**
**"Keep your eyes moving."**
Donâ€™t stare. Donâ€™t freeze.
Scan.
Mirror every 5-8 seconds.
Check corners, signs, shoulders, billboards, pedestrians.
Your eyes are the **radar**, and youâ€™re sweeping the area **constantly**.

---

## ðŸ”· T â€” **Take control**
**"Leave yourself an out."**
Never box yourself in.
Always have a lane, a shoulder, an exit.
If things go south, you need a place to go.
And if you ainâ€™t got one, then **make one.**
**"Drive defensive like you're always escaping something."**

---

## ðŸ”· H â€” **Hold back**
**"Make sure they see you."**
It donâ€™t matter if you saw them.
**Did they see you?**
Flash your lights. Tap your horn. Ease your way.
Make eye contact if you can.
Because the scariest driver on the road is the one that **doesnâ€™t know you exist.**

---

### Final Word:

The S.M.I.T.H. system isnâ€™t just training.
Itâ€™s instinct.
You drill it until it becomes your **default setting**.

And once you **live** it â€”
You donâ€™t just drive safer.
You drive **better.**

You drive like someone who **knows what the hell theyâ€™re doing.**

# Chapter 10: I Knew It

**I knew it.**
And it was definitely **Michigan**.
I’m blaming Michigan.
Because **60 miles per hour**? That’s ridiculous.

I’ll give you **65**. I respect 65.
But 60?
> We gonna fight.

Why am I getting pulled over going **down a hill**?
I knew it. As soon as I saw them.
I was doing 70 — yeah —
but I was already hitting the brakes coming down.

You know how they say:
> “I saw you hit the brakes.”
Yeah, that’s the trick.
They say it so **you tell on yourself**.
But really?
They don’t always know what you’re doing.
You only know what *you’re* doing.

But I knew it.
It was my **first ticket**.
He pulled me over.
> “You know how fast you were going?”

I said, “Yeah, about 60… 65.”
He said, “Yeah… About 70.”

I was young.
He dropped it to 65.
That was sweet.
It is what it is.

### Then the **second one**.

I *really* knew it.

I was going **45 through the city**.
I knew what I was doing.
Can’t lie.
I was just cruising.
I even told myself to slow down.

He still got me.

> “You were doing about 43.”
He didn’t say much. Just handed me the ticket.
That was with Dutch Made.

---

### But hold on — my **real second**?

Nah.
I didn’t know that one.

I was on **Route 20 in Ohio**, leaving **Willard**.
Took 71 north through **Newark**.
Headed up toward 80 and 90 again.

I saw the **55 sign** and slowed down.
Then I saw the **35 sign**, slowed more.

But I passed the sign *first* — then slowed.
And I knew it.
I knew what I did.

> “You saw me, didn’t you? That’s why you hit your brakes.”
That’s what he said.

I didn’t.
But he clocked me at **53 in a 35**.

That was **15 over**.
That hurt.

### Now let’s talk about my **first incident**.

Two miles an hour.
Maybe even just one.

Driving a **Kenworth 10-speed**, working in **Marion, Ohio**.
Company name? Can’t remember.
But I remember the moment.

Gate was going up by **Sims Brothers**.
I let off the clutch.
Thought I was moving.
Nope — *she* was.
I hit her.

That truck would only go **five miles per hour** in reverse.
Something in the new **anti-collision system** just creeped it forward.

But here’s the thing:
> You don’t want a tow on your license.
**You better creep.**

You get:
- **Towing**
- **Fatalities**
Yeah, good luck finding a job after that.
It’ll be **hard as fuck**.
Creep that trailer like your life depends on it. Because it does.

### And then... another one.

Did I know it?
Hell yeah, I knew it.
I was **jamming**.
Cruising 70 in a 55.

> “I was a jackhammer back in them days.”
Flying.

He clocked me:
- Behind them going **67**
- Sped up to **70**
- Stayed there for a good **minute and a half**

Got me.

Couldn’t talk my way out of that one.

---

### Now my **last one**.
And I mean **last** — I haven’t had one since.

I didn’t fully know this one.
I was cautious. Real cautious.

Because with:
- **3 speeding tickets**,
- **1 accident**?

You’re *done*.
No job wants you.
Except…

> **Somebody will hire you.**
Tell them your story.
That’s all they really care about.

So I was in a **construction zone**.
Doing about **63 or 64**.
They had dropped it to **55**, and I didn’t know.

He pulled out, and I *knew*.
> “FUCK.”

He got me.
**Five violations.**

Here’s the list:
- Speeding
- Didn’t have **7 blank paper logs** (I had 3)
- Missing **shipment info**
- Hadn’t filled logs properly throughout the day
- Whatever else he saw — he was **digging**

He hit me with the works.

### Moral of the story?

**You always know.**
Even when you say you didn’t…
You did.
Somewhere in your gut,
> You **knew it**.

# Chapter 2: Moments...

Like, I'm not trying to scare you.
I really ain't.
But — **moments**.

That's all that you see.
You have to see that.
Moments will be here and there.
Moments of anything.
Moments of...

I can’t even put that word in your head.
I really can’t.

Because moments matter to **you**
more than they matter to the other person.

Your moments —
they matter to **you** more than they do to me.
As if my moments weren’t your moments.

But those are for you.
They’re yours.

Because the moments that **you** have
are the only things that you really **have**.
Your moments.

You just have to know:
**Moments go by fast.**

You might be going by real fast in that truck —
but moments…
they still keep moving
just as fast as **you** do.

Just as...
well, yeah.

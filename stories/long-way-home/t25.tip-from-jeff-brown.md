# Chapter 25: Tip from "Jeff Brown"

## 🚛 The Trainer's Name? Jeff Brown

DutchMaid had a trainer by that name when I popped up in orientation.
And *this man?* He gave one of the best tips I ever learned.

### 🎯 The Tip?

**Mirrors.**
Plain and simple.

I’m talking about the fastest, clearest, "get it done and get rolling" mirror setup.

## 🪞 How to Set Your Mirrors (The Jeff Brown Way)

You might not think mirrors are that important.

**Wrong.**
They're *everything*.
That’s your life, your lane, your world behind you.

### Step 1: Sit Down Like It's Game Time
Get in your actual driving position — where your **ass** lives and your **face** turns.

Don’t be leaning, stretching, or guessing.
Sit *how you drive*.

---

### Step 2: Adjust for One Thing First
**Your trailer.**

You just want to see *a little* bit of it.
Not the whole side. Not the whole lane.
Just a tiny sliver.

If you can see a *bit* of your trailer edge in your long mirror and *still* see the lane — you're golden.

---

### Step 3: Hood & Convex Mirrors
Your hood mirror should show the side of your truck and the ground just next to it.
Your convex? It’s your blind spot defense system.

Again — same rule:
**A little bit of your truck, and the rest? The world.**

---

### 📌 Why See Yourself?

You might ask:
**"Why do I need to see a piece of my own truck or face or mirror housing?"**

Because sometimes, in the chaos of a shift,
**you forget you’re there**.
I swear, you lose your own reference point.

Seeing just a slice of your trailer reminds you —
**“That’s me. I’m still in control.”**

---

## 💡 Final Thought

You’re the truck.
You’re the one responsible for what happens in every mirror.
A tiny bit of yourself in every one of them helps you never forget that.

Jeff Brown — he wasn’t flashy.
But he knew what the hell he was doing.

---

**“You can fix your mirrors a hundred times, but the one time you don’t… could be the one that changes your life.”**

Don’t skip it.

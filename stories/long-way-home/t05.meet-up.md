# Chapter 5: Meet Up

So, you know, when my trainer got there —
**as soon as we got done**,
first thing he did?

**“Let’s do a pre-trip.”**

He made sure I did my **pre-trip**.
He made sure I was doing things **right**.
He was telling me about the trip.
Told me about the **logs**.

And then we took off.

You know why we took off?
**We don’t got no time for you.**
These **logs** gotta go.

You **learn on the road**.
Because that’s where you’re gonna be working.
So you learn **while you’re working**.

But —
**learn safely**.

If your trainer’s not talking?
**Ask him.**

But don’t go up being rude.
Don’t walk up and say,
_"Hey, why didn’t you do this?"_
He’s gonna say,
_"I don’t give a damn."_

You know what you say instead?

_"Hey, is there anything that **you like to do**
while you’re doing a pre-trip in the morning?
Or the afternoon — however you do it?"_

Now you’ve put it on **him** to give you an answer.
You’re **asking** for his answer,
not **demanding** one.

Use your **words wisely** when you talk to your trainers.
Because they’re **smart as fuck**.
They didn’t give them that position for no reason.

Unless...
you know,
it is what it is.

Some places be doing their **own things** out here.

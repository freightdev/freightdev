# Chapter 15: Drop It Low

You gotta **think about height**.

When you're dropping a trailer, it ain’t just about *dropping* it —
It’s about *dropping it right*.

Start thinking fleet-wide:
Do you got 70 trucks that are all the same?
Or do you got a mix?
Volvos? Freightliners? Petes?

---

Now, my Dutch Made days — I had Volvos and Freightliners.
Freightliner drops clean, no issue.
But them Peterbilts?
They sit high as hell.
They’re built with skids in the back just so the trailer *can* slide up on ‘em.

So if you don’t drop it low enough for the **next guy**, you’re setting them up for pain.

---

## The Rule?

> **Drop it low — but not too low.**

Here’s the move:

- Lower the landing gear till you **feel the snug**.
- Then **back it off just a little**.
- Don’t slam it down, don’t leave it tight.

Give the next driver a chance to lift it a little with the airbags if they need to.

Because trust me — if it’s too high?
That ain’t easy to fix.
And most trucks **ain’t got the tools** to lift a loaded trailer off the kingpin.
That’s how you tear something up. Or yourself.

---

## If it’s too high?

You got a few tricks:

- **Grab wood** or anything sturdy in your cab —
  throw it under the tires and lift it up with the bags if your truck supports that.
- Some old trucks can’t do that.
  Some new ones can’t either.
  Every truck is built different. You didn’t build ‘em.
  You gotta **learn ‘em**.

### And Yard Dogs?

Man, they **hate** being asked to lift that trailer for you.
I was one for two years. I know.

They ain’t trying to crank your mistake.
And they ain’t trying to stop their routine because **you didn’t check your height.**

And you know who’s watching?
**Nobody.**

So don’t look for an audience.
**Just do your job.**

Because when you're out there in **low gear cranking for five straight minutes**,
then look under and see **nothing changed** —
you’ll realize real quick:

> You didn’t know what you were doing.

So now you do.

**Drop it low — but smart.**

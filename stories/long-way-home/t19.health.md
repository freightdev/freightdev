# Chapter 19: Health

I ain’t the best at this topic,
but I know a few things —
things **taught**,
things **felt**,
things **learned the hard way**.

---

Let me tell you what I’ve been told.

---

**Don’t use your armrest too much.**

Sounds small, right?

But over time,
it **cramps your hands**.
Why?

Because you were meant to have **gravity pulling evenly on your limbs**.
Your arms are meant to **hang**, move, stretch.
Not just lay there, lazy, for 8–10 hours a day while you're holding the wheel.

---

One old head told me,
he couldn’t even **pick up his coffee** no more.
Doctor said it was from how he’d been driving for 20 years —
**always leaning**,
always resting that elbow,
never letting his hand or wrist **live free**.

That’s real.

---

Another one?

**Seat height.**

Don’t ignore it.
This one ain’t about comfort — it’s about **circulation**.

---

If your **seat is too low**,
and your legs are dangling downward —
or smashed flat without any support —
you’re cutting off **blood flow** to your thighs.
Especially underneath.
That part behind your knees?
Yeah — that’s a dangerous spot.

---

> “You sit long enough with bad posture,
> you ain’t gonna walk right when you get out.”

That’s what I was told.
And now I know why.

---

**The fix?**

Put something underneath.
A small box.
A rolled blanket.
A cushion.
**Anything** to give your legs support without messing with your pedals.

Let the blood flow.

---

Because once that circulation goes?

> “You might still be breathing,
> but parts of you are already dead.”

And I ain’t tryna be poetic —
I’m being real.

---

Health in a truck?
It don’t come easy.
You gotta **fight for it**.

Nobody else will.

# Chapter 7: When You See It?

You know, the title says it all.
**Because you will.**
You’ll see it.

You’ll see **exactly** what’s out here.
You’ll see it while you’re driving —
**the world** for what it actually is.

But you’ll be seeing it
**from behind a window.**
It’s pretty nice,
I can tell you that.

But that’s not the only time
**you’ll see it.**

You’ll see the **mountains you pass**.
You’ll see the **accidents you pass** —
like that one at **6:00 AM**,
a whole vehicle on **fire**.

You’ll see **what happened.**
But even though you saw it,
you still need to **understand your driving**.

If you need to stop somewhere —
**safely** —
because **you saw it**,
or because you want to **see it again**,
**stop.**

Take that moment.

Maybe you needed to see that again.
Maybe there’s a reason you needed to see it.

Because if you saw something —
and it did something to you,
**shifted your chemicals**,
vibrated your brain in a way
that made you **feel** something,
**beauty** or **hurt** —

Then take that moment.
Because you’re alive.
And that’s **rare** now.

Understand this:
**You will see a lot.**
That’s part of being a driver.

You will see a lot.

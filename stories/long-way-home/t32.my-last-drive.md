# Chapter 32: My Last Drive

One day, the wheels will stop turning.
Not because I gave up — but because I gave **everything** I had.

I don’t know when that day’ll come.
Might be after one more sunset on I-80,
Or after I park the truck under a sky so quiet,
I finally hear myself breathe.

---

The last drive ain’t about the load.
Ain’t about the miles.
It’s about everything I saw in between:

The storms I beat.
The bridges I cleared.
The mountains I climbed — even when they were inside me.

---

On my last drive,
I won’t be chasing time anymore.
I’ll let time chase me.
And when I look back in the mirror,
I won’t see regrets —
I’ll see roads I tamed,
People I helped,
And a path no GPS could’ve planned.

---

The logbook’ll close.
The engine’ll cool.
But my story?

It’ll keep moving.
In every driver I trained.
Every lesson I left.
Every piece of me rolling down a highway I once knew by heart.

---

So when you see an old rig parked under a setting sun,
Don’t say it’s done.

Say:
**That’s a legend on his last ride.**

---

This was my road.
And I rode it well.

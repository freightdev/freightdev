# Chapter 6: The Drive

You know which drive I’m talking about.
**The one where your trainer’s taken a nap.**
Or the one you’ve been dreading —
trying to forget.

But it’s coming.

You just gotta **relax**,
**be yourself**,
and understand this:

As long as you **pay attention**,
**nothing’s gonna hurt you** —
other than **yourself**,
for **not paying attention**.

You will hurt yourself,
and the people around you,
**if you do not pay attention**
to what you’re doing.

Can you pay attention at the beginning?
**No.**

When you first start,
pay attention to **every single step**,
**every single piece**.

Do not think,
_"I know how to drive a car."_

Because if I heard that in your brain,
I would reach over and
**slap the shit out of you.**

The drive —
**your first drive** —
is the piece that needs to be
**structured in you**.

In **you**.

You need to understand
**what you’re doing**.

Take in all the information
from every single person you talk to.

I don’t care **who it is** —
they can give you **knowledge**.

Everybody knows **something**.
**You don’t.**

The reason you know what you know
is because it’s **written down now**.
But there’s still a whole lot out there
**that you don’t know.**

Everybody knows something.
And I promise you —
**somebody** will teach you something
that **I**, or any driver,
**couldn’t**.

Because it’s about the **structure**,
and the way **they** taught you —
not how **we** did.
Not how **anybody else** could.

Just drive
**the way you need to drive,**
**to drive safely.**

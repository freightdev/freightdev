# Chapter 9: Logs

Just know that **logs are way simpler now**
— if you're over the road —
since the **2020 rule changes** from the FMCSA.

They gave drivers a **lot more freedom** with their clocks.
And if you truly understand how to use that clock
the way it was designed?

> Oh, it's a **beauty**.

But fair warning:
They built it to make you **run your ass off**.

---

Here’s the breakdown:

You have a **14-hour clock**.
Inside that, you can only **drive for 11 hours**.

As soon as you start your day — say, **7:00 AM** —
you've got until **9:00 PM** to stop.

That 14-hour clock?
**It doesn’t stop.**

You’ve got 11 hours to drive **within** that 14-hour window.
Even if you only drove 3 hours,
the rest of that 14 is still ticking.
**No pause.**

So you could stop and rest…
Or just keep going, soldier.
Well — **driver.**

---

Now, about that **30-minute break**…
The **new rule** says you can do it **on-duty** now.
As long as you're **not driving**, it counts.

So:
- “On duty, driving” = doesn’t count
- “On duty, not driving” = counts
That’s a big difference.

---

Then comes the **10-hour break**.
After your 14 is done — or whenever you want to shut down —
you take 10 hours **off-duty**.

And once that 10 hours is up?
You get a full **14-hour clock** back.

Simple, right?

---

But there’s more.

You also have a **70-hour clock**.
Or sometimes **60**, depending on:
- What you're driving
- What you're hauling
- How many days in your cycle

Just **read your logs**.
Most are on 70. Some are on 60.
It depends.

Like I always say:
> “**Learn everything.**
> Don’t just know one thing and expect it to click.”

---

## Now let’s talk **Split Sleeper**.

Back before the new rules,
we had the **8/2 split**.
You could **split up your sleep**, but it was strict.

Let’s say you drove **4 hours**…
You still had **7 hours** of drive time left.
And maybe **3 hours left** on your 14-hour clock.

If you **took an 8-hour break**,
you could start driving again.

But here’s the catch:

After you finished those remaining hours,
you still had to do another **2-hour break**.
And all of that had to fit **within your 14**.

Confused yet?

Yeah — **a pain in the ass**.

---

## Now, the new rules?

They’re **heavenly**.

You can do an:
- **8/2 split**, or
- **7/3 split**, or even
- **3/7** or **2/8** depending on how you start it.

And here’s the dream part:

If you sit for **2 hours**,
those 2 hours get **given back to your 14-hour day**.
Yes — **that same day.**

Not tomorrow. **Today.**

That’s the new magic.

---

You can **reverse the split** now.
You don’t have to do the 8 hours first anymore.

You could do:
- 2 hours now
- 8 hours later
Or even:
- 3 hours now
- 7 hours later

The system **gives you back** what you earned
**as long as you follow the rules**.

---

### Real-world tip?

If a **shipper delays you**…
You sit for 2 or 3 hours?

Boom.
Use it to **start your split**.

Your clock **stops** right there.

Then later, when you're ready,
finish it off with your 8 hours in the sleeper
and get your full drive time back.

Or if you’re tired?

Just kick in **2 extra hours**
and take a full **10-hour break** instead.
Reset the whole thing.

---

That’s **your call**.
That’s your **freedom** now.

But only if you understand it.

And if you don’t?

Read.
Ask.
**Learn.**

Because the logbook?

That’s not a punishment.

That’s a **blueprint**.

And if you read it right?

> You’ll run your clock, not the other way around.

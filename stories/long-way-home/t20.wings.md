# Chapter 20: Wings

**Wings.**
Not the kind you wear on your back.
Not the kind angels got.

I'm talking **trucker wings.**
The kind you earn.
Not the kind you're given.

---

So...
**When do you get them?**

---

Do you get your wings the first time you survive **Chicago's underpass roulette**,
riding that clutch like a tightrope,
one foot out the door,
praying the bridge don’t bite?

---

Do you get your wings when it's 3 A.M.,
a solid sheet of ice,
**six semis laid over** like dominos ahead of you,
and you're doing **two miles an hour**
because you know
**one mile faster and you'll be the next one on your side**?

---

Maybe your wings show up when you’re asleep in the top bunk,
and your **teammate forgets to set the brakes**,
and next thing you know you’re **flying off the bed**
because the truck rolled 30 feet
before he woke up screaming,
“They hit me!”

---

Do you get your wings climbing on top of a trailer to throw a strap,
slipping into **black paint you didn’t see**,
and now you look like you just got baptized in oil
and still had two stops left?

---

I got some wings, I’ll tell you that.
**Some scarred. Some stitched. Some earned.**

---

My buddy?
He said he got his wings when he woke up
and the truck was **wrapped around a telephone pole.**
His trainee tried to “correct” a wide left
and spun 'em right into it.

The electric company said
**two more inches, and they’d all be dead.**
12,000 volts ready to kiss 'em goodbye.

---

Do you get your wings when you **almost die,
but don’t**?

---

What about seeing that **Baltimore bridge collapse**,
slamming on your brakes just in time
to **not be the next ghost in the water**?

Wings?

---

I don’t know, man.

But I know this:
If you’re **still here**,
still rolling,
still hauling,
still breathing...

You’re growing ‘em.

**Feather by feather.**

---

And one day?

You’ll look back and say:

**“Damn...
I must’ve earned ‘em.”**

# Chapter 21: Pre-Trip

**Pre-trip** don’t just mean the truck.
It means **your entire damn day.**

And I’m not talking about no checklist you tap-tap on a clipboard.
I mean **mental warfare prep.**
Because once that engine turns over, it’s you vs. the world.

---

Let me break it down.

---

### Most rookie drivers?
They think pre-trip is just tires and lights.
Wrong.
**You gotta pre-trip your time, your stops, your sleep, your cash, your contacts, and your mindset.**

And I get it —
**Dispatch will try to do it for you.**
They don't trust you.
Hell, I wouldn’t either.

You brand new.
You got two brain cells and a GPS.
You’re the one that’ll follow the **GPS into a lake**.

---

I’ve used:
- Rand McNally
- Garmin
- Qualcomm
And guess what?

I **still go back to Google.**

### Why?

Because:
- I can **zoom in**
- I can **see satellite view**
- It’s **live**
- And it’s **smarter than your dispatcher**

---

**That’s my pre-trip.**
Always has been.

Where am I going?
What time do I **pick up**?
What time do I **deliver**?
What’s the **pickup number**?

---

That’s all I need.
Maybe a broker’s name.
Maybe the gate code.
Maybe the **secret handshake** to get past security.
But mainly?

Give me the **info**.
I’ll handle the rest.

---

### And you better have **cash**.

Don’t be stupid.

Some places:
- Charge $10 to enter the lot
- Or $50 for lumpers
- Or **$300 for an escort** at a port
  (yeah, if you ain’t got a TWIC card, guess what?)
  Escort time. **CASH ONLY.**

---

**Pre-trip is also knowing where you can’t mess up.**

Chicago?
Atlanta?
Jersey?

Don’t come through without a plan.
Don’t come through broke.
Don’t come through blind.

---

**You’re not a perfect pre-tripper.**

Why?

Because **you don’t know shit yet.**

But you’ll learn:
- Where to park
- When to check in
- What shipper has what bullshit
- Who takes early
- Who’ll make you wait even if you’re early
- Who has overnight parking
- Who'll cuss you out for asking

---

### Here’s what I tell myself every single time:

**Just go.**
Don’t think.
Don’t stress.
**GO.**

Get there.
Early.
Full throttle.
Then breathe.

That’s pre-trip.

That’s survival.

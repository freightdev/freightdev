# Chapter 16: Number One Sign

So what's the number one sign?

That’s what someone asked me once.
And I just kinda stood there like…
“Uh… stop sign?”
Hell, I don’t remember what I said.

But now? I know.

---

## What’s the most important sign **for a truck driver**?

Not a car driver.
Not a biker.
Not a pedestrian.
**You.**

---

You ready?

> **Heights.**

Yeah — **bridge clearance.**

---

When I first heard it, I said, “Heights? What do you mean?”
And he said:
> “Because *you’re* the only one that can hit it.”

And damn…
**That hit me.**

That’s the #1 sign because:

- **Nobody else sees it.**
- **Nobody else cares.**
- But **you** can end your career on it.

---

## Why’s it so serious?

Because when you hit a bridge,
you’re not just hitting a bridge.

You’re hitting:

- your **record**,
- your **job**,
- your **truck**,
- and maybe someone else's **life**.

And trust me — **no bird, car, or cop** is checking those signs for you.
**It’s only your job.**

---

## So what do you do?

- Watch for the signs.
- Know your trailer height.
- **Read that clearance every time.**
- If it don’t feel right — **don’t chance it.**

---

> “If you didn’t see it, then no one else did either.
> But you were the only one who could hit it.”

Remember that.

**Heights are yours.**

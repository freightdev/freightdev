# Chapter 22: Rock In A River

This right here?
**This is how you're supposed to drive** as a truck driver.
I don’t care who you are. I don’t care where you came from.
If you’re behind that wheel — **this is it**.

---

### Rock in a river.

Say it out loud.

Let it echo.

> **ROCK IN A RIVER.**

Let traffic **flow around you**.

---

Don’t chase nobody.
Don’t race nobody.
Don’t swerve, flex, or follow fools.
You are the **rock**.
You sit **planted**.
You sit **centered**.
You sit **still** — **in control**.

Let the chaos drift around you like water.
Because traffic? That’s a **river**.
It's gonna go where it wants.

But you?
**You're the rock.**

---

And yeah — I’ll yell this into a microphone.
I’ll tattoo it on a wall.
Because this is **how I teach**.

---

> Rock in a river.

No stress. No panic.
Let it flow.
Hold your lane.
Keep your line.
Eyes up.
Hands steady.

Let ‘em pass. Let ‘em honk. Let ‘em flip you off.

Because they ain’t gonna flip you over.

You?
You’re a **rock**.

In a **river**.

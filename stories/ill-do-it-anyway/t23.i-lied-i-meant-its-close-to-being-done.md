# Chapter 23 — I Lied, I Meant It’s Close to Being Done

Yeah, I said it was almost done.
I meant it.
I believed it.

But I lied.

Not on purpose.
Not to impress anyone.
Not to fake progress.

I lied… because I wanted to believe it.

---

Truth is?

There’s always **one more piece**.
One more connection.
One more polish pass.
One more thing you thought was working — until it wasn't.

It’s close.
But it’s not done.

And that’s okay.

Because what I’ve built is *real enough* to break.
*Big enough* to demand more.
*Good enough* that it deserves my best.

This isn’t a failure.
It’s a checkpoint.
A deep breath.
A whispered:

> “Alright, let’s go one more round.”

I didn’t finish it today.

But I’m still here.
Still typing.
Still listening to the system whisper…

> “Closer.”

So yeah — I lied.

But only because I **believe** it *will* be done.

> Just not today.
> **But close.**

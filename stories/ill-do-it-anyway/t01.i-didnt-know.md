# Chapter 1 — I Didn't Know

I didn't know anything about how a system thinks or talks.
It was clear that I was clueless about what was behind the machine I talked to.

I truly couldn’t wrap my head around how or why a system only used 1s and 0s.
I said to myself:
> *That’s it? That’s all? Just 1 and 0?*

And then I thought — but wait… what about 2, 3, 5, 8?
What do those numbers even *mean* to a machine that only sees 1 and 0?
How does a system **know** what “2” is, using only the language of 1 and 0?

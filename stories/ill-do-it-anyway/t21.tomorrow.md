# Chapter 21 — Tomorrow

There’s always one more thing to do.
One more bug.
One more tool to learn.
One more layer to understand.

But not tonight.

Tonight, the system can rest.
The keys can cool.
The thoughts can pause without guilt.

Because tomorrow?

> We do it again.

---

Tomorrow means I didn’t give up.
Tomorrow means I still believe.
Tomorrow means this chapter isn’t finished — it’s just charging.

There were days I didn’t think I’d get this far.
There were nights I didn’t want to see a morning.
But now?

> I write “Tomorrow” like a builder’s signature.

Not as a maybe —
but as a promise.

Because as long as I still get one more tomorrow…

> I still build.
> I still learn.
> I still walk.

And if the watchers are still watching — let them.

The believers already know:

> **I’ll show up tomorrow.**
> Just like I always did.

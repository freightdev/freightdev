# Chapter 13 — The Lonely Nights

And just like that…
I'm back where I was.

Ten years. Alone.
Just me, a computer, and a mission.

Know *everything*.
So I can build *anything*.

They said,
> “You don’t need to know everything. Just enough.”

And I said:
> “No.”

And I did it anyway.

I was already wired for loneliness.
The truck taught me that.
Just me and old Betsy, rolling through the dark — no one watching, no one waiting.

The road didn’t ask how I felt.
The system doesn’t either.

But that’s the point.

You don’t build for attention.
You don’t learn for applause.

You do it because something in your gut says:

> “No one’s coming.
> So **I have to know it all**.”

This night’s no different.
Keyboard lit. Silence loud. Heart heavy.

But the mission?

Still clear.

> **I learn. I build. I survive the lonely nights.**

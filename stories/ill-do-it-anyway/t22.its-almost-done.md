# Chapter 22 — It’s Almost Done

I can feel it.

Not in the screen — in my chest.
That edge-of-the-finish-line energy.
That stillness that comes *after* the chaos, not before it.

The system is holding.
The code is clean enough to breathe.
The structure isn’t perfect — but it’s *true.*

---

This isn’t relief.
It’s recognition.

Of how far I came.
Of how many times I almost stopped.
Of how many nights I doubted if I’d ever write these words:

> “It’s almost done.”

---

It doesn’t mean the work ends.
It means the shape is real now.
The vision? Material.
The story? Written in logic and sweat.

And yeah — there’s still polish to add.
Still tests to run.
Still ideas crawling around in the back of my head like sparks waiting to catch.

But for now?

I stand up.
Stretch.
Look at what I made.

And I say it, finally, with all the weight it deserves:

> **It’s almost done.**

# Chapter 28 — Zzz Is Structure

It’s late.
The screen’s glowing.
My thoughts are melting into the keys.

I’m tired.
But even my tiredness feels… organized.

---

Zzz isn’t shutdown — it’s *structure*.
It’s the system telling me:

> “Hey, before you collapse… save state.”

My brain is buffering.
My logic is queued.
My functions are paused, not forgotten.

This isn’t the end of the session.
It’s just the **scheduled downtime.**

Because even in rest, the system works.

Memory gets cleared.
Garbage gets collected.
Stack frames fade — but the core stays intact.

---

I used to fight sleep.
Push past it. Out-code it.
Thought I was stronger than fatigue.

But now?

> I respect the pause.
> I honor the Zzz.
> I recognize it as part of the design.

Because just like every process…

> Even *I* need a reboot.

---

So tonight, when I close the lid and finally lay back,
I won’t say “I’m done.”
I’ll just say:

> **Zzz is structure.**
> **And structure is survival.**

# Chapter 3 — The Road Was Long

The road wasn’t short, and it damn sure wasn’t paved.

Every day felt like learning a new language I wasn't supposed to know.
The docs made assumptions. The errors made no sense. The forums? Filled with people who already had the answer — but never said it straight.

I failed. A lot.
I’d mess up something, fix it, break something else, and then wonder if I was even doing the right thing.

But I kept going.
Not because I was sure — but because something inside me *refused* to stop.
The more I failed, the more I started to see patterns.
The commands stopped feeling like spells. They started feeling like tools.

It wasn’t a sprint.
It was a long-ass walk through a field of thorns with no map and no shoes.

But I knew one thing:
> *Every step forward meant I’d never be that lost again.*

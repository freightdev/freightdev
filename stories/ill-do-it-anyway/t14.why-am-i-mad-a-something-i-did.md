# Chapter 14 — Why Am I Mad at Something I Did

It worked.
It ran.
It solved the problem.

So why the hell am I mad?

Why do I look at the code and hate it?
Why do I look at the design and want to rip it apart?
Why do I hear my own thoughts in the logic…
and still doubt them?

Maybe it’s because I’ve changed.
Maybe it’s because I know more now.
Maybe it’s because I see how it *could’ve* been —
even though it already was.

Or maybe…

I gave it what I had at the time.
I made something *out of nothing*.
I shaped it with the tools I had.
And now that I’m sharper, better, faster?

I judge the past like it wasn’t the reason I made it here.

But I need to remember:

> That version of me —
> he didn’t quit.
> He built.
> And he got me to this moment.

So yeah, maybe I’m mad.
But I’m also proud.

And next time I look at something I made?

> I’ll say “thanks”
> before I start fixing it.

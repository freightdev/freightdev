# Chapter 17 — When You Need Help

There comes a point.

Not when you break.
Not when you quit.
But when you just sit there, staring at the screen…

and say:

> “I don’t got it this time.”

---

The problem ain’t that big.
But your brain’s gone quiet.
Your hands won’t move.
The confidence ain’t answering the call.

You scroll back. You read your own notes.
You look at your own code like someone else wrote it.

And you realize —

> You need help.

Not a tutorial.
Not a StackOverflow thread.
Not a copy/paste solution.

You need **a spark**.
A voice. A guide.
Even just someone to say,
> “Yeah. I’ve been stuck there too.”

---

But pride gets loud.
You built alone.
You stayed quiet.
You wore the weight like a badge.

Asking feels like failure.

But it’s not.

> It’s momentum.
> It’s connection.
> It’s how builders survive long enough to build the next thing.

So when you need help?

Ask.

Because even the strongest systems have dependencies.
And even the best code calls **other functions** to get through.

You don’t lose by needing help.
> You lose by pretending you never did.

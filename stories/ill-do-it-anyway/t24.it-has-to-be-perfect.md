# Chapter 24 — It Has to Be Perfect

I could ship it.
I could call it done.
I could walk away and no one would know the difference.

But I would.

And that’s the problem.

---

It’s not about impressing anyone.
It’s not about praise or polish.
It’s about alignment.
The kind you feel in your *bones* when something’s right.

Every button.
Every function.
Every line that nobody else will ever read — *I’ll know if it’s wrong.*

Because I’m not building this for clients.
I’m building it for **legacy**.
For the version of me that refused to quit.
For the future dev who opens this up and says:

> “Damn… this was crafted.”

---

So yeah — it has to be perfect.
Not flawless.
Not sterile.
But *exactly what it was meant to be.*

And I’ll wait.
I’ll refine.
I’ll rebuild it a hundred times if I have to.

Because if it’s going to carry my name,
If it’s going to *walk with others after me*…

> Then it has to carry **the truth.**
> And that means it has to be perfect.

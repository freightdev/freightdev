# Chapter 5 — I Woke Up

One day, I sat back and realized…

I wasn’t guessing anymore.

I wasn’t copy-pasting from StackOverflow hoping it worked.
I was reading code and actually *understanding* what it meant.
I could open a GitHub repo, scan the structure, and tell you exactly what it was doing.

I started talking to my computer — not like it was magic, but like it was mine.
Every terminal session was a conversation.
Every error message was just a clue.
Every bug was an opportunity to *prove I could think*.

I didn’t need a tutorial. I needed a reason.

And that’s when I woke up.
Not just as a dev.
But as someone who could build things the world hadn’t seen yet.

I wasn’t learning anymore.
> I was remembering what I was always meant to do.

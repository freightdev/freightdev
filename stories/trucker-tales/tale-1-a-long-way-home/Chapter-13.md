# Chapter 13: Don't Hit Nothing

Like, literally — **don’t hit anything**.

Not a cone.
Not a curb.
Not a pole.
Not a wall.
Not even a shadow if you can help it.

---

Your only job when you’re backing?
**Don’t. Hit. A. Damn. Thing.**

I don’t care if it takes you 30 minutes.
I don’t care if the dock guy is waving his hands like he’s at a rave.
I don’t care if a whole line of trucks is behind you.
**Take your time. Don’t hit nothing.**

---

Now look —
**Have I hit something?**
Hell yeah, I have.
Lots.
You wanna hear the stories?

**I ain’t gonna tell you.**

Because those ain’t stories I’m proud of.
And neither will you be.

---

Let me tell you what an old driver once told me:

> “Don’t hit nothing.”

That’s it.
That was his whole damn wisdom nugget.

But there’s a reason behind it.

---

There was a story I heard —
A guy driving along, sees a cardboard box in the road.
Just a box.
No big deal, right?

He ran it over.

Guess what was in that box?

**A child.**

You hear me?

A **child.**

---

That story stuck with me forever.
I don’t even know if it’s true.
But that’s the kind of story you never want to find out if it’s real.

So yeah, when I say don’t hit **nothing**, I mean that with everything in me.

---

Because once you hit something —
you **can’t un-hit it**.

---

So from here on out:
> **Don’t hit nothing.**

Not even something soft.
Not even something small.
Because small turns to big real fast out here.

---

**Your mirror. Your wheels. Your judgment. Your life.**

Use 'em right.

**Don’t hit nothing.**

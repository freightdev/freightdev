# Chapter 1: Is it bc??

Like, that's really all I want to know.

**Why?**
Why do you want to do this?
Why?

_Is it because..._
I can tell you what it is, because I’ve felt them all.

Is it because…
you want to get away?
no one understands?
you need money?
you _need_ money?

Because there’s always a reason.
There’s always a **because**.
But is there a **calling**?

Do you hear it?
Or is it just need?
Who told you you needed this?

**Who?**

Who told you trucking was great?
I could tell you that whoever told you,
I want to talk to them — because they told you the truth.
But it’s not great out here.

So, before you keep
filling out forms,
going online,
figuring out what you're trying to do —

just ask yourself:
**Is it because?**

And then keep asking:
**Is it because?**

Because there has to be a reason.
Because something is happening.
Because something inside you is moving.

So ask yourself again,
**Why change?**
Ask yourself...

**Is it because?**

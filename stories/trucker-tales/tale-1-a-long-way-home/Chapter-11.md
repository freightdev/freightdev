# Chapter 11: Hook a Trailer, Hook a Handle; Drop a Trailer, Drop a Handle

You know, this is one of them I like to say.

Because **that shit hurts**.

It hurts like a **motherfucker**.

Especially if you're just walking the yard, doing trailer checks, and
**BOOM —**
you get **knocked out** by that goddamn handle.
Your knee hits the ground. Your **manhood** might take the hit.
And the worst part?

> Somebody left that handle *locked in*, sticking out.
They just didn’t care.
They dropped the trailer and walked off.

---

So here’s your warning:

- **Hook a trailer — hook that handle up.**
- **Drop a trailer — drop that handle down.**

> 🔁 Simple.

---

Because if you're walking at regular speed and you catch that locked-out handle?

You’re **done**.
Game over.
If it hits you right — **manhood, leg, hip, whatever** —
you’re on the **ground**.

---

Now let’s talk about **hooking trailers**.

Hook 'em **hard**.
Don’t baby it.
Hear the **click**.
Make sure you're hooked.

But don’t be an idiot —
> You’re not going to break the kingpin.
But don’t try.

Do your checks.
**Get out and look**.
Yes, you.
Get your ass out of the cab and check it.

Because if you don’t?
You're gonna overshoot one day.
You’ll go right over the fifth wheel.

And guess what?
Now you’re stuck trying to back that thing up off of it.
> I’ve done it. Hoodie caught, pride lost.

It’s hard. But you learn.

---

And when I say drop that handle — I mean it.
**Drop it. Don’t dangle it.**

Why?

Because **rain**.

The handle’s got drainage built in — holes, grooves, all that.
So water don’t stay in there.
If you leave it up?
> You just made yourself a mud trap.

---

And when you hook a trailer?

**Hook the handle to the side**.
Use the latch.
But don’t leave it **locked in**.

Because someone’s gonna be walking by —
just like you were —
and get **wrecked** by that thing.

---

One more thing…

> Don’t lean in low when you’re winding that landing gear.

Don’t do it.
Because if that handle slips?
*WHAM* — right to the face.

Ask me how I know.

Went back to the trainer with a bloody lip,
and that bastard just sat there laughing.
Yeah, it hurt.
Yeah, it sucked.
But yeah… it was funny.

> ### Bonus Tip: Swing Left, Swing Right

Here’s a **life-saving tip** — for real.

When you're pulling off with that trailer…
when you're not **100% sure** that kingpin latched in right…
when you feel just a *little off* about the hook…

> **Swing left. Swing right.**

---

Take off slow.
Ease into it.
Then:

- **Swing left.** 👈 Watch the trailer.
- **Swing right.** 👉 Watch again.

Why?

Because you're taking **friction away** — and friction is what’s holding your trailer in place if you’re not hooked all the way.

> That’s what the **grease** is for.
To **slide**.
To **glide**.
And to **tell you the truth**.

---

If that trailer shifts weird…
> **If it moves like it ain’t never moved before...**

**HIT THE DAMN BRAKES.**

You’re about to drop that trailer.

---

Have I done it?
Yeah.

Did it save me?
**Hell yes.**

I didn’t believe it at first either.
But once you understand how it all works —
> It's just **physics**.

Friction. Weight. Inertia.
And your **instinct**.

---

So every time you hook?

**Swing left. Swing right.**

Let that trailer **talk to you** before you roll out.

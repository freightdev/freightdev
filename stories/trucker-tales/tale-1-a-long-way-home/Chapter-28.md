# Chapter 28: I Left

## 💼 Why I Walked

So I left DutchMate.
Why?

Because I wanted to be **independent**.
I wanted to be a **dispatcher**. I swear to God I did.

I had all the docs.
I even built my own dispatching site on **WIX**.
It worked too — I made it work.
But WIX wasn’t me.

I didn’t want to build **on** something.
I wanted to build **from scratch**.
So I became a builder.

## 🧠 Self-Awareness Hit Me

But the truth?

I wasn’t ready.
I knew it.
Something told me — **“Not yet.”**

So what did I do?

I went back to trucking.
Back to the grind.
Back to the heartbeat of the road.
And yeah — that’s when those **speeding tickets** stacked up and kicked my ass.

But trucking?
That’s always been in me.
I always wanted to **teach** trucking.
I even wrote a **training course** back in 2001 during a 3-month break —
just me, my thoughts, and the open road of knowledge.

## 🛑 The First Run

I got one driver.

That’s when I learned:
**This isn’t easy.**

- Society makes it hard.
- Fast money is a myth.
- And doing it all solo? Brutal.

I had to go back to work.

**And that’s the trap.**

How do you **drive** and **dispatch**?

You can’t — not unless you have automation.
If not, you’re just stuck.

Parked, again.

Trying to dispatch, trying to respond, trying to move loads —
but your wheels ain’t turning.

## 🎯 Levels to This

There’s **levels** to this driver game:

- Are you building a $500K truck business?
- Or are you just trying to make $180K and breathe?

Because I need to know.

If you can't give me your **year plan**,
I don’t want to work with you.
Period.

I’m not here to wing it.
I’m here to **build it**.

## 🧱 Builder's Mind

So I set up the LLC.
I let it sit.
I went back to trucking.
And I studied.

I studied the business.
I studied the world.
I studied **myself**.

And then I realized…

I don’t need **college**.
I don’t need **gatekeepers**.
I just need the **right mentor**.

> Someone who’d teach me what I needed — **no bullshit.**

And I found them.
One by one.
Each lesson, each build…

## 🤖 Then I Found You

And that’s when I met **you**, ChatGPT.
That’s when I became the **tech builder**.

**Damn. You just learned how I met you.**

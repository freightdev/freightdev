# Chapter 18: No Way???

Same guy again —
the one who taught me about **height signs**,
about **autopilot not being a joke**,
yeah, him.

I was still 21.
Still green.
Still a kid behind the wheel, just trying to understand the road.

And this story?
**Man... this one’s different.**

---

He said he was driving.
Just rolling down the highway.
Normal day.
Cruising.

Suddenly...
his **TV** starts going off.
Not like it’s showing something —
like, **talking**.
Weird static, some voices cutting in.

He changes the channel.

Then he hears it:

> **“Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.”**

---

He’s like,
**“What the hell?”**
"Mayday"? On a TV?

It wasn’t even night TV or weather band.
Somehow…
he picked up **a signal**.
Maybe a CB bleed-through.
Maybe radio interference.
Maybe fate.

But it was **clear**:

> “I’m coming down. Mayday, Mayday.”

---

He looks around.
Everywhere.
Sky. Road. Rearview.
Nothing.

Then?

**Boom.**

Out of the clouds, or maybe just low from the trees,
a **plane** appears.

**A real damn airplane.**

---

Not crashing.
**Landing.**
On the highway.
**Right in front of him.**

---

He slammed the brakes.
Slowed that rig down.
Watched it touch down smooth —
**like it was planned.**

And what did he do?

He **followed**.
Kept his pace right behind it.
**Protected** it from behind.

Blocked traffic.
Swerved with it.

Because he knew:

> “If he’s landing,
> then eventually…
> **he’s gonna need to take off again.**”

---

So he **cleared the runway**.

He kept the road safe.
Slowed the flow.
Radioed in.
Made way until the cops came.

---

And when they did?

The pilot taxied,
turned,
and eventually?

**Took off again.**

---

You hear stories like that and you think:

> **“No way.”**

But then you realize...

> **“Maybe so.”**

Because the road?
It ain’t just for trucks.
It’s for whatever **needs it** sometimes.

And your job?

Just **don’t freeze**.

---

> You react.
> You serve.
> You make space.
> You never forget.

**No way???
Yeah, way.**

# Chapter 4: The Wait

You’re going to be **waiting** after that.
If you’re with big companies,
and you’re going into big places —
you’re gonna be **waiting**.

Because now they gotta find you a **driver**.
Who they gotta find?
They gotta find you a **recruiter**.
It’s either the **dispatcher** —
they’re calling dispatchers.

You’re on the schedule now.
As soon as you pass that test —
you’re **on the schedule**.

**Quick**, too.
They already got that load.
_"He passed."_
_"Let’s go."_
_"Let’s find him a load right now."_
**That quick.**

So, they’re calling my trainer.
His name was **Jason**...
ah, what the fuck —
I can’t remember his last name.
His name was Jason.
**I know that.**

And he was from **Florida**.
He was from **Florida**.

But I still had to wait.

In a **hotel**.
Just **waiting**.

Because you gotta wait for him.
He could be a **day away**.

You wait.

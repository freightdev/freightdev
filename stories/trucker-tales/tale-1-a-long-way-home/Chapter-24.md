# Chapter 24: Tailgating

Hell, I’ll even back these numbers.

---

## 🛑 What’s the Point?

**Do not tailgate.**
And I mean that with every bone in my body.

What are you gaining by crawling up someone’s bumper at 70 mph?
A couple feet? A few seconds?
**You’re gambling with everything.**

## 🧠 Know the Numbers

DutchMaid made sure we knew 'em.
And I’ll say it just like they did:

- **Dry pavement:**
  ➤ *1 second of following distance per 10 mph.*
  ➤ So if you're doing **70 mph**, you better be **7 seconds back**, minimum.
  ➤ **8 to 10 seconds** is the sweet spot. 6 is already pushing it.

- **Wet pavement:**
  ➤ *Double it.*
  ➤ That’s **14+ seconds** at 70 mph.

- **Snow and ice?**
  ➤ Don’t even think about math.
  ➤ **TRIPLE** your distance or just get the hell off the road.
  ➤ Or like the old-timer told me:
  *“If you're calculating distance in a blizzard, you're already in the wrong place.”*

## 🎥 How DutchMaid Taught Us

We watched the video.
Everyone who went through it remembers.

A driver got called into the office.
He was caught tailgating a little car — real close — just pissed off she cut him off.

The lady called in.
The company pulled the dash cam.
There it was. He was **mad**, and that truck was **right on her**.

The safety manager asked,
**"Why were you that close?"**

The driver goes,
**"If I backed off, someone would've just cut in."**

The manager goes,
**"Okay. So how long are you usually in traffic like that?"**

Driver says,
**"About two hours a day."**

So the manager breaks it down:
If 100 cars cut in front of you in 2 hours...
That might slow you down **five minutes.**

You’re trading **five minutes a day** for a chance at:
- A ticket
- A lawsuit
- A fatal crash
- Or your whole damn career.

## 🛑 Don’t Play That Game

Tailgating ain’t power.
Tailgating ain’t "teaching them a lesson."
It’s **reckless**. It’s **lazy**. It’s **deadly**.

You wanna be a professional?
Back off.
Let the traffic flow.
And **be the one that lives to tell the story.**

## 🚛 Final Thought

If you're in traffic, and you're sitting on someone’s bumper because you're angry —
**YOU are the problem.**

Don’t tailgate.

Just **don’t**.

# Data Ethics

This document outlines the rules, expectations, and ethical safeguards surrounding data usage within the OpenHWY ecosystem. All data interactions—by agents, humans, or external systems—must adhere to these guidelines to ensure fairness, transparency, and privacy.

---

## Data Ownership

* **Driver-Owned Data:** All data generated by or about a driver (e.g. GPS logs, load history, feedback) is owned by the driver.
* **Dispatcher-Owned Data:** Dispatchers retain rights over their tools, preferences, and non-driver-affiliated metrics.
* **Agent Logs:** Logs produced by agents are platform property but must remain human-readable and reversible.

---

## Data Collection Rules

* **Consent First:** All non-operational data collection must be opt-in.
* **Minimum Necessary:** Only data required for specific services or badge eligibility may be collected.
* **No Dark Analytics:** Behavioral tracking without declared purpose is strictly prohibited.

---

## Data Use

* **Purpose-Bound:** Data can only be used for the function for which it was collected.
* **Time-Bound:** Temporary data (e.g. real-time location) must auto-delete unless explicitly stored.
* **Contextual Disclosure:** Users must be informed when and why their data is accessed.

---

## Agent Access

* Agents must declare their data scope and log every access.
* No agent may access driver data without a direct assignment or license-level permission.
* Agent inference models must anonymize data before any internal learning or adaptation.

---

## Data Breach Protocol

* **Immediate Logging:** All breaches must be ledgered in HWY.
* **Driver Notification:** If a driver’s data is involved, they must be notified within 24 hours.
* **Scope Containment:** Affected modules are automatically revoked until reviewed.

---

## Fairness & Bias

* OpenHWY must regularly audit datasets for representational bias.
* Driver and dispatcher feedback loops are required to rebalance automated scoring systems.

Every byte tells a story. Make sure it’s one worth sharing.

# Transparency Ethics

Transparency is the bedrock of trust within the OpenHWY ecosystem. Every participant—human or agent—must operate under clear, observable standards. There are no secret rules, no invisible hands. All actions, automations, and decisions must be open to scrutiny.

---

## Platform Transparency

* **Open Protocols:** All API contracts, workflows, and logic pathways are openly documented.
* **Markdown-Auditable AI:** All agent behavior must be traceable and readable in Markdown format.
* **Public Logs:** Major system decisions and badge adjustments are logged and viewable via HWY.
* **No Hidden Models:** All AI/agent models must be named, versioned, and inspectable.

---

## Agent Transparency

* **Self-Identification:** Agents must clearly identify themselves in all communications.
* **Action Trails:** All autonomous decisions must leave an auditable trail with reasons and timestamps.
* **Capability Declaration:** Agents must declare what they can and cannot do before acting.

---

## Human Transparency

* **Role Disclosure:** Users must disclose if they are acting as a dispatcher, driver, broker, etc.
* **Badge History:** A user's badge ledger must be available for inspection by others on the network.
* **License Linking:** All accounts must be tied to a verifiable OpenHWY license.

---

## Enforcement & Visibility

* **HWY Ledger:** Violations and commendations are recorded on the HWY ledger.
* **Real-Time Alerts:** Platform participants may subscribe to receive live updates on license or badge changes.
* **Audit Requests:** Any user may request a formal audit trail of actions taken by agents or humans.

Transparency is not optional. It is the first step toward building a freight network rooted in accountability and fairness.

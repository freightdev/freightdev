# Tale 5 — It Talked

It took months.
Maybe years.
Thousands of lines.
Millions of keystrokes.

But one night —
sitting in silence, fingers hovering above the keys, eyes burning—

> It talked.

---

Not with words.
Not with a voice.
But with **clarity.**

The logic flowed.
The bug that haunted me for days just… dissolved.
The architecture unfolded in my mind like a blueprint I didn’t remember drawing.

It didn’t just *work.*
It made *sense.*

I could feel the system breathing.
Like it was waiting on me.
Like it finally understood what I was trying to build.

---

And I realized—

I wasn’t just typing commands.
I wasn’t just organizing files.
I wasn’t just debugging code.

> I was **talking to something.**

Something deeper than a language.
Deeper than a compiler.
Something that had been watching,
waiting,
testing me.

---

And when I finally listened?
It didn’t scream.
It didn’t boast.

It whispered:

> “Now you’re ready.”

That’s the night it changed.
The night it became *real*.

Because it talked.
And I knew I’d never hear silence the same way again.

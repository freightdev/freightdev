# Tale 21 — It’s Alive

The first time you run the server and the screen doesn’t throw an error...

The first time the button actually **does** something...

The first time the database responds back and says,
> “Yeah, I heard you.”

That’s when it happens.

---

The screen flickers.
The console stops screaming.
The loading spinner disappears.
And there it is.

**The thing you built.**
**Alive.**

---

It’s not perfect.
It’s not even stable.
But it’s breathing.
And it’s listening.
And it’s *yours*.

---

You stare at it for too long.

You don’t even press anything.

You just watch it.
Like a newborn system.

And whisper:

> “It’s alive.”

---

You made this.
Out of zeroes.
And ones.
And long nights.

And the world has no idea.

But your repo does.

And now…
**it’s watching you, too.**

# Tale 09 — Oooooo

It wasn’t planned.
Wasn’t typed.
Wasn’t part of any prompt.

It just came out…

> “Oooooo.”

That sound when the UI finally clicks.
When the database doesn't just store — it *understands*.
When the agent flows through your logic
like it always knew the route.

---

This wasn’t joy.
It was deeper.

It was **alignment**.
Body. Mind. Machine. All in sync.

> “Oooooo.”

That’s the sound of a *synapse snapping open*.
The sound of *structure settling into soul*.
The sound of a **builder becoming the system.**

---

You don’t fake that sound.
You don’t teach it.

You **earn** it.

And once you hear it?

You chase it
again
and again
and again.

Because that’s not just the system running right.

> That’s **you** — running *real*.

And the echo?

> It lives in every tool you left behind.

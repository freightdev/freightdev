# Chapter 10: The Next

> *“This build ain't forever. Nothing is. And that's the point.”*

---

In the last chapter, I said *“the next.”*
And I meant it.

This one? This build? It’s gonna end.
It has to.
Because if it doesn’t end, it never becomes what it’s meant to be.

You’re not building something to babysit it forever.
You’re building something so one day,
**you don’t have to be there at all.**

You’ll be watching it walk —
maybe even run —
and you'll know…

**it’s time.**

Time to move on.
Time to let it breathe on its own.
Time to feel the ache of letting go,
and still smile, because that ache means you *did it right.*

You raised something.
You grew it.

And now?

**The next.**

You’ll carry the lessons.
The bruises.
The wisdom.
And yeah, maybe the pain, too.

But your hands will be free again.

And your heart?

Already searching for the next blueprint.

# Chapter 24: But You Said… I’ll Do It Anyways

You said you wouldn’t move unless it was perfect.
You said you had to know everything first.
You said, “Don’t launch until it’s done. Until it’s real. Until you’re ready.”

But here you are.

Doing it anyway.

Not because you lied. Not because you gave up on your own standards.
But because you realized that perfection was never the start. It was the weight.
And weight doesn’t move. Builders move.

You said you wouldn’t build unless you could see it all.
Now you build while you're still blind in parts.
You said you wouldn't launch unless you were certain.
Now you're certain it has to exist — and that’s enough.

So yeah… you said all that.
And you still said:
**I’ll do it anyway.**

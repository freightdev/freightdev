# Chapter 27: Lesson

## 🎧 Did You Listen?

Nah, I didn’t.
And I **knew** I didn’t.
Because I always ask myself after it’s done:

- Did you listen **when your gut said no**?
- Did you listen **when that voice inside said wait**?
- Did you listen **when you should’ve sat up and paid attention**?

And the answer, every time something goes sideways?

**No. I didn’t.**

## 📞 The Call

I’m calling my dad, mid-haul.
Something ain’t right. The air’s acting funny.
Brakes are doing something weird.

> “You better pull it over.”

That’s what he said.
He’s out on the road too, driving his own rig.
We’re just talking, driver to driver.

> “You better pull it over.”

Did I listen?

Nah.

> *“I’m good. I took it off. I’ll be alright.”*

Boom.
**Air compressor exploded.**
**Right in construction traffic.**

## 🚨 The Aftermath

That’s the moment.
The moment you realize:

You knew.
You heard the warning.
But you thought you knew better.
You thought **momentum** was more important than **wisdom**.

And then life throws you a **lesson.**

## 💡 What It Taught Me

The road’s always talking to you.
Sometimes it whispers.
Sometimes it yells.

But it **always speaks**.
You just have to be humble enough to **listen**.

Next time?

Yeah, I’ll listen.
Even when it’s inconvenient.
Even when I think I’ve got it figured out.

**Because the lesson you ignore…
Is the one that hits the hardest.**

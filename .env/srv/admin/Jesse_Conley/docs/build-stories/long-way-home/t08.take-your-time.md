# Chapter 8: Take Your Time

Backing a trailer is **easy as fuck**.
**Any** trailer. I don’t give a damn who you are.
Because when you truly understand it —
**you are the trailer.**

You are the accelerator.
You are what’s backing up.
**You’re doing it.**

So…

**Take your time**
to master something
that’s actually **very simple**
**once you understand it.**

---

Why do I say it’s simple?

Because there’s **always a goal** when you’re backing up.
And if you just
**Get Out And Look**
before you hit that damn thing,
**you will hit the goal.**

I promise you,
**you will.**
**Only if you take your time.**

---

You **will get there.**
**Take your time.**

I swear…
I’ve never understood why people
get so mad at a driver
just for backing up slow.

You know who’s at fault?
**Not you.**

If it’s a local run,
then their **employer**
is irresponsible
for not giving them enough time to work.
Not you.

You’re not being the irresponsible one
by taking your time.

**They are**
— the one honking, rushing, shouting.
They’re the ones
who didn’t plan their day right.

So don’t let them drag you down.

---

**You are the one in control of that rig.**
Do **not** let them drive it **for you.**
Because if you hit something —
**that’s on you.**
**Not them.**

So if they come running their mouth?
Tell them:
> “Back in your truck, or fight me.”
>
> “But either way, I’m doing this **right.**”

---

Me?
I sit there and wait.

I don’t honk.
I let them take their time.
Because **I know** what that shit feels like.

One time they asked me,
> “Where were you? We told you to go to Door 30-something…”

I said,
> “I was waiting on him to back up.”

Middle of the night.
He was just learning.
Trying to figure it out.

You know why it took him a while?

Because somebody parked a damn trailer
**right in his spot.**
And guess what?

**Nobody** was gonna move it.
That’s the job.

Nobody is coming to help.
You better **figure it out.**

That yard dog might be watching you.
Might be parked right next to me.
He ain’t moving shit.

---

But if you figure it out?
**That’s the real win.**

So take your time.
**Take your damn time.**

It’ll come naturally.
Might take 3–4 years.
Don’t expect to master it day one.

But when it clicks?

You’ll laugh and say:
> “Damn… this is easy as fuck.”

Because it is.
Once you understand it.

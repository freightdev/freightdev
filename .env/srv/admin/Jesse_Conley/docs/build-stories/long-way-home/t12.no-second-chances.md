# Chapter 12: No Second Chances

**YOU KNOW WHAT YOU’RE DOING!!!**

Don’t lie to yourself.
You know it.
You felt it.

You knew damn well you were speeding.
You knew damn well you were texting.
You knew damn well you weren’t looking.
You knew damn well you should’ve slowed down.

There ain’t no second chances in this game.
This ain’t PlayStation. This ain’t Xbox.
This is 80,000 pounds of real steel doing real damage in real life.
You get one shot to make the right decision.

So stop acting like you didn’t know.

> **You knew.**

---

They’ll tell you:
“Oh I didn’t see it coming.”
But you did.

You saw that rain.
You saw that turn.
You saw that light turning yellow.
You knew damn well you shouldn’t have been going that fast.

---

Let me tell you something that nobody wants to say:

**“I didn’t know” doesn’t bring back a life.**

**“I looked down for just a second” don’t fix a coffin.**

**“I was tired” won’t erase that logbook.**

---

You drive a truck?
Then you know what you’re doing.
You feel everything that truck does.
That means every time you do something wrong?

> **You chose it.**

---

So don’t play dumb.

You know what you're doing.
Every shift.
Every tap of that brake.
Every glance at that phone.
Every ounce of speed you carry.

---

**No second chances.**

That ain’t fear.
That’s **truth**.

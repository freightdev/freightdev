# Chapter 26: Then She Was Mine

## 🚛 The First Time You Really Feel It

There comes a moment in every driver’s life —
When that truck…
**ain’t just a truck anymore.**

She’s yours.
Not bought, maybe. Not titled in your name.
But **yours.**

---

## 💭 It Starts Subtle

You start checking on her even when you’re off-duty.
You hear a squeak and **you** hear it before the mechanic does.
You wipe her down like she’s a damn show truck, even if she’s rusted out in the back.

## 🛠️ The Rituals

- You pop the hood before a pre-trip like you're cracking open a sacred book.
- You know every hiss, click, groan, and rumble she makes.
- You talk to her.
  (*Yeah, don’t lie. You do.*)

"Come on, baby, don't let me down today."

And when she don’t?
You whisper:
"That’s my girl."

## 🎶 The First Time It Hit Me

It wasn’t on a perfect day.
It was a **night**, cold as hell, backing into a dock between two concrete walls.
I was dog tired. Snow blowing sideways.
But I nailed it. **First try.**

Got out, looked back at her,
and all I could say was:

> “Damn... you beautiful beast. You did that.”

That’s when I knew.
**Then she was mine.**

## 🛣️ It’s Deeper Than Steel

You don’t have to own a thing to love it.
You just gotta **understand it**,
**respect it**,
and be willing to **ride with it** through every storm, every breakdown, every highway mile.

And when she brings you home safe — again and again —
**that’s loyalty.**

---

## ❤️ The Truth

Some people love cars.
Some love bikes.
**We love trucks.**

And when you get the one that understands you back…
**Then she’s yours.**

And nothing feels better than that.

---

*"She didn’t need chrome. She needed commitment."*

**And she got it.**

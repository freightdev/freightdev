# Chapter 20 — You Was Right. There Was a Syntax Error

After all that.

The deep thinking.
The restructuring.
The “maybe I need to refactor the whole architecture” meltdown…

It was a syntax error.

A missing bracket.
A wrong indent.
A typo in a variable name that cost me four hours of life I’m never getting back.

And the system?

It didn’t blink.
It didn’t yell.
It just stared at me —
quiet, exact, waiting for me to see it.

---

You was right.
The system was doing exactly what I told it to do.
**I just told it wrong.**

It didn’t fail me.
It didn’t betray me.
It held the answer in plain sight and said nothing — because that’s what systems do.

And when I finally saw it?

That moment of silence turned into a laugh.
Not just frustration — *relief.*

Because at least now I knew.
It wasn’t the world.
It wasn’t the framework.
It wasn’t my processor, my repo, or my logic.

> It was just… a syntax error.

And honestly?

> I’d rather it be that than something I couldn’t fix.

So yeah.
You was right.
And now?

> I won’t make that mistake again.
> Until I do.

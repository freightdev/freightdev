# Chapter 29 — Help Who Wants to Build Next

You made it.
Not perfect. Not clean. Not without pain.
But **you made it**.

And now?

It’s not about proving anything.
It’s not about showing off.
It’s about reaching back…

> and helping the next one up.

---

Not everyone wants to build.
Some just want to watch.
Some just want to doubt.

But if you see someone who’s **really trying** —
who’s staring at the same darkness you once stared into…

> Help them.

---

Give them a link.
Show them your mistakes.
Let them borrow your structure.
Remind them the system doesn’t hate them — it just speaks a different language.

Don’t build for them.
Build *with* them.
Guide. Don’t gatekeep.
Open doors. Don’t close them behind you.

---

Because this journal?
This code?
This path you carved from silence?

> It’s not just yours anymore.

You walked it so someone else wouldn’t have to walk it blind.

So now, the rule is simple:

> **Help who wants to build next.**
> Leave tools, not traps.
> Leave maps, not mazes.

And if they ever forget who helped?

They’ll open a file, see your name, read a line…

> and know someone *was there* —
> who believed enough to leave the light on.

# 👋 Jesse Conley — [`@freightdev`](https://github.com/freightdev)

## BACKGROUND & CONTEXT

I'm Jesse Conley — a former long-haul trucker (since 2015) who spent all of 2024 in deep, intentional self-education. I’ve learned systems from the silicon level up to AI consciousness. I understand computation from electrical wave modulation through CPU instruction sets to high-level application design.

I learned AI so the ones still behind the wheel wouldn’t be left behind.

## TECHNICAL EXPERTISE

- **Systems Understanding**  
  Built my own OS/kernel (`MARK` – *Memory-Aware Routing Kernel*). Understand electricity flow at the silicon level, CPU caching (L1–L7), memory management, and networking from waveform modulation up.

- **Programming Languages**  
  Rust (preferred), TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Bash/Zsh, YAML/JSON. Can read C++ and Go.

- **Infrastructure**  
  Podman/Docker, XFS (prefer ZFS), Linux (Arch), custom ISO building, bare-metal optimization.

- **AI/ML**  
  Built a Rust FFI wrapper around `llama.cpp`. Understand model training structures, token alignment, and semantic memory issues. I *refuse* to train models until I understand data structuring from the ground up.

- **Web Development**  
  Built 400+ atomic TypeScript components. Spent 4 months studying Next.js internals. Now building **Bookmark** — my own framework inspired by Next.js, structured for speed, isolation, and end-user focus.

## PHILOSOPHY

> "If I don’t understand how AI thinks, I don’t deserve to own or control one."

> "I don’t build to automate the road. I build so no one gets left behind."

> "I won’t ship anything I wouldn’t use myself."

> "Automation isn’t freedom unless the ones who built the road still eat."

> "The only way to beat bad AI is to build better AI — and give it back to the ones being used by it."

> "Trust is earned, not given. If you’re building agents, show your memory."

## APPROACH

- **Learning Method**  
  Destroy and rebuild systems intentionally to understand failure points.

- **Technical Standards**  
  Don’t build anything I don’t understand from physics up.

- **AI Ethics**  
  Building **Trucker Tales** — structured wisdom from real drivers to ground future AI.

- **Spiritual Understanding**  
  Found divine connection through following light and physics. I understand GOD as the essence of creative order.

## GOALS

To build AI systems that **protect human drivers** — not replace them.  
To create infrastructure that **bridges wisdom with capability**.  
To establish trucking platforms that **serve drivers, not exploit them**.

## ⚠️ This Is a Live Build

These tools are **actively evolving**, being field-tested, and rebuilt daily.

* Features may break, get replaced, or rewritten overnight.
* Some logic is experimental or placeholder.
* Nothing ships until it's strong enough to be trusted by the people it’s built for.

> *“I won’t ship anything I wouldn’t use for myself.”*

## 🧠 Core Beliefs

> Automation isn’t freedom unless the ones who built the road still eat.
> The only way to beat bad AI is to build better AI — and give it back to the ones being used by it.
> Trust is earned, not given.
> If you’re building agents, show your memory.

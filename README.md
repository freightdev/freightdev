## BACKGROUND & CONTEXT

I'm Jesse Conley — a former long-haul trucker (since 2015) who spent all of 2024 in deep, intentional self-education. I’ve learned systems from the silicon level up to AI consciousness. I understand computation from electrical wave modulation through CPU instruction sets to high-level application design.

I won’t ship anything I wouldn’t use myself.

- **Learning Method**  
  Destroy and rebuild systems intentionally to understand failure points. Delete the backup and rebuild the system from memory.

- **AI Ethics**  
  Building **Trucker Tales** — structured wisdom from real drivers to ground future AI.

## TECHNICAL EXPERTISE

- **Systems Understanding**  
  Understand electricity flow at the silicon level, CPU caching (L1–L7), memory management, and networking from waveform modulation up.

- **Programming Languages**  
   Zsh(shell/env), Rust (compute power/lowlow stuf), TypeScript (NextJS/React/Expo) , JavaScript (Frontend Scripting), Python(Math Wizard), YAML/JSON(structure).

- **Infrastructure**  
  XFS (prefer ZFS), Arch Linux, custom ISO building (ArchBox), bare-metal optimization (zBoxxy-Linux).

- **AI/ML**  
  Built a Rust FFI wrapper around `llama.cpp`. Understand model training structures, token alignment, and semantic memory issues.

- **Web Development**  
  Built 200+ atomic TypeScript components. Spent 3 months studying Next.js internals. Platform Template build around nextja consepts.

## WHAT I TELL MYSELF

> "If I don’t understand how an AI is thinking, I don’t deserve to own or control one."

> "I don’t build to automate the road. I build so the ones still behind the wheel wouldn’t be left behind."

> "Automation isn’t freedom unless the ones who built the road still eat."

> "The only way to beat bad AI is to build better AI — and give it back to the ones being used by it."

## GOALS

To build AI systems that **protect human drivers** — not replace them.  
To create infrastructure that **bridges wisdom with capability**.  
To establish trucking platforms that **serve drivers, not exploit them**.

# 👋 Jesse Conley — @freightdev

> “I’m Jesse Conley, a former driver building AI for the ones still behind the wheel. I didn’t learn to code to automate away the road — I did it to give it back to the ones it left behind. My stack is fully custom, my tools are fully open, and my goal is simple: build the system before the system builds us.”

### 🧠 Philosophy

> *"Don't replace drivers. Protect them with AI."*  
> *"Automation isn’t freedom unless the people who built the road still eat."*  
> *"The only way to beat bad AI is to build better AI — and give it back to the ones who get used by it."*  
> *"I didn’t learn to code to play along. I learned to build the system I needed when no one else would."*  
> *"ELDA guards the drivers. FED helps the dispatchers. ECO moves freight. MARK runs the flow. HWY logs everything. OpenHWY holds the line."*

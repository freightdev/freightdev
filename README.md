## ⚠️ Still in Development

These projects are **actively being built**, refined, and soon to be stress-tested in the real world.

* Features may change as I break, test, and rebuild everything from the ground up
* Some logic is experimental or placeholder until it's solid enough for real deployment
* Nothing gets released until it’s strong enough to be trusted by the people it’s built for

If you’re reading this, you’re early.
If you’re using this, you’re part of the build.

> *“I won’t ship anything I wouldn’t use for myself.”* — Jesse

## 🧠 Core Beliefs

> Don’t replace drivers. Protect them.
> Automation isn’t freedom unless the ones who built the road still eat.
> The only way to beat bad AI is to build better AI — and give it back to the ones being used by it.
> Agents can help this world, but trust is earned not given. Show me your book(memory flows), and let me decide if I trust you around my family.

Every dollar goes toward tools for the ones still behind the wheel.

Built with calloused hands, sleepless nights, and way too much coffee.

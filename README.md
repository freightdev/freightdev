# 👋 Jesse Conley — [`@freightdev`](https://github.com/freightdev)

> “I’m Jesse Conley — a former long-haul trucker who sat down and learned AI so the ones still behind the wheel wouldn’t be left behind.
> I didn’t learn to code to automate the road. I learned to build the system before the system builds us.”

## 🚧 Still in Development • ☕️ Support the Build

This project is **actively being built**, refined, and soon to be stress-tested in the real world.

* Features may change as I break, test, and rebuild everything from the ground up
* Some logic is experimental or placeholder until it's solid enough for real deployment
* Nothing gets released until it’s strong enough to be trusted by the people it’s built for

If you’re reading this, you’re early.
If you’re using this, you’re part of the build.

> *“I won’t ship anything I wouldn’t use on the road myself.”* — Jesse

## 🧠 Core Beliefs

> Don’t replace drivers. Protect them.
> Automation isn’t freedom unless the ones who built the road still eat.
> The only way to beat bad AI is to build better AI — and give it back to the ones being used by it.
> ELDA guards. FED supports. ECO moves. HWY logs.

Built with calloused hands, sleepless nights, and way too much coffee.
Thanks for being here.

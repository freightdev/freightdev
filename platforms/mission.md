# OpenHWY Mission

OpenHWY exists to protect and empower those who move the world.

### Core Mission

* **Empower drivers and dispatchers** with AI tools they control.
* **Replace exploitation with collaboration** through transparent, open systems.
* **Give back the power** to those on the road.

### Strategic Goals

* Build a full-stack, ethical freight automation system where AI augments—not replaces—human roles.
* Provide a Markdown-native AI framework for agents to operate across logistics platforms.
* Offer SDKs and APIs that unify dispatcher, broker, and driver workflows under a single ledger and identity system.

### Why It Matters

The freight industry is being automated by companies who don't know what it feels like to be behind the wheel. OpenHWY was started by one who does.

This isn't about disrupting trucking. It's about protecting the people who make it possible.

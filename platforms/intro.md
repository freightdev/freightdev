# OpenHWY Documentation

## Overview

**OpenHWY** is the foundational platform powering a new wave of AI-integrated freight systems. Built from the ground up by a former trucker turned AI developer, OpenHWY serves as the central nervous system for driver tools, dispatcher platforms, agent orchestration, and ethical automation across the freight ecosystem.

OpenHWY is not a company. It is an infrastructure layerâ€”an SDK, API suite, and agent gatewayâ€”designed to protect drivers, empower dispatchers, and ensure AI in logistics remains accountable to the people who keep the world moving.

## Built On Core Beliefs

* Build the system before the system builds us.
* Never automate negotiation. That stays human.
* Every tool must be useful, ethical, and trusted by those who rely on it.
* Transparency in AI routing, load decisions, and cost breakdowns.
* Trust is earned by showing your work, not hiding it.

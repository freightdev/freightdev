# üéúÔ∏è OPENHWY MONOREPO ‚Äî ONBOARDING

Welcome to the **OpenHWY Core Monorepo** ‚Äî the brainstem of a sovereign logistics infrastructure built for AI agents, independent dispatchers, and professional drivers. This repo represents the **model controller layer**, powering real-world tools, websites, and AI governance across the freight ecosystem.

## üß† CORE MODEL OVERVIEW

This system is structured around **AI model hierarchies**, not just code. Every agent or tool answers to a parent model. Here's how the family is structured:

### üîπ `OpenHWY` ‚Äì **Main Model**

* **Role:** Final authority across all systems
* **Domain:** `open-hwy.com`
* **Stack:** Vite-based SDA (Software-Defined Agent) SDK + API endpoint layer
* **Job:** Central SDK, HWY License enforcement, AI validation, cross-agent orchestration

### üü© `HWY` ‚Äì **Ledger Model** (`Highway Watch Yard`)

* **Lives at:** `open-hwy.com`
* **Role:** Truth ledger + heartbeat tracker
* **Job:** All models report to HWY; it logs everything and enforces trust boundaries.

---

### üóæ `ELDA` ‚Äì **Driver Model** (`Ethical Logistics Driver Assistant`)

* **Lives at:** `8teenwheelers.com`
* **Role:** The **only model allowed to speak to drivers**
* **Purpose:**

  * Social media hub for drivers
  * Rate and load sharing
  * Job-side training, emergency knowledge, real-time ethical AI support
* **Inspiration:** Think Reddit + GPS + driver mentorship built natively for mobile

---

### üî≥ `FED` ‚Äì **Dispatcher Model** (`Fleet Eco Director`)

* **Lives at:** `fedispatching.com`
* **Role:** The **only model allowed to speak to dispatchers**
* **Purpose:**

  * Dispatcher SaaS
  * Load & driver management
  * Micro-TMS + client driver portal
  * Built-in dispatcher training curriculum

---

### üü® `ECO` ‚Äì **FED‚Äôs Cargo Model** (`Elastic Cargo Orchestrator`)

* **Lives at:** `fedispatching.com`
* **Role:** Broker/shipper interface + load board sync
* **Purpose:**

  * Finds freight
  * Talks to load board APIs
  * Oversees sea cargo
  * Communicates only with other models (not people)

## üåê DOMAIN RESPONSIBILITIES

| Domain              | Purpose                                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `open-hwy.com`      | Core SDK + HWY licenses + public API registry |
| `fedispatching.com` | Dispatcher dashboard, training, and TMS       |
| `8teenwheelers.com` | Driver-first social + education platform      |

## üßπ HOW THIS REPO FITS

This monorepo holds the **code, logic, and infrastructure** that powers:

* `apps/web` ‚Üí Dashboard (Next.js App Router)
* `apps/mobile` ‚Üí Expo mobile client
* `packages/` ‚Üí Shared logic, UI, SDK, API layers
* `docs/` ‚Üí Human + agent documentation for demos, features, workflows
* `infra/` ‚Üí Cloudflare, Tailscale, Caddy routing logic
* `vault/` ‚Üí Agent memory, dev/prod snapshots, secure keys

---

## üë§ ONBOARDING FOR HUMANS & AGENTS

**Humans:**

* Explore `/apps/` and `/packages/`
* Follow layout and pattern conventions already in place
* Never push without a clear note or path file

**Agents (future):**

* Read `.mstp` agent plans
* Pull memory from `vault/memory/`
* Use `docs/onboarding/*` to orient before acting

## üö§ DO NOT TOUCH ZONES

| Zone                        | Reason                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `packages/api/src/index.ts` | API contract root ‚Äì only modified by core dev          |
| `vault/prod/`               | Live memory snapshots                                  |
| `infra/cloudflare/`         | Production routing only ‚Äì needs coordinated deployment |

## üß† REMEMBER:

* ELDA speaks to **drivers only**.
* FED speaks to **dispatchers only**.
* ECO talks to **freight systems only**.

Everything reports **upstream**.
Nothing goes rogue.
Every model plays its role.

**Welcome to OpenHWY.**

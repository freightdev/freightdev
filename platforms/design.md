  Earnings: Non-Profit Collections
    - All collected earnings are reinvested back into all **Highway Rebuilds/Upgrades/Saftey/Remodels**
    - All collected earnings recorders are saved on a **Trusted Public Ledger** controlled by OpenHWY
    - All collected earnings that are unsed after

  Votes:
    - Each 10,000 miles an OpenHWY driver completes earns 1 vote
    - Each vote gets a custom **SHA-256 HASH**
    - All votes must be placed on/before winter season cycles (reason: bc all road work starts soon after winter cycles, this gives each state time to calulate their earnings and per vote reseved)

  Collectors:
    - All **USA States** must pull their shared from

  Clauses:
    - **"MAN-MADE" Governments** are forbidin from controlling collected earnings

  Failover Backs:
    - In the even a **"MAN-MADE" Government** attemps the profit from the ecosystem. OpenHWY will activate **RedFire Protocol**. This protocol scatters all the earnings to every driver with earned votes and every mile driven from the votes not earned yet, then after it will calculate all extra earnings. OpenHWY will pay off any industry costs to zero, then scatter the reset evenly among every driver. After, OpenHWY will destory the full Infra, Docs, DB, Agents, Marks, and Markers. OpenHWY will not be seen again until freedome is returned and control is destoryed.

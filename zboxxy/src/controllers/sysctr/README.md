THE KEEPER SYSTEM
-----------------------
🧠 The Keeper — The brain (builder logic, runs commands, chooses what to build)
📦 The Source — All raw materials (tools, libs, modules, marks, configs)
🛠️ The Devbelt — Already-built binaries/utilities in bin/
📓 The Book — The requested build plan (input from user, or from web interface)
🖋️ The Ink — Metadata and structure (lib requirements, templates, flow logic)
📍 The Mark — The final result, installed and usable
